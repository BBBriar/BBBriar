of this study is to learn and practice what it means to abide in Christ. To take off the old self with its sinful habits and live according to the grace of God as new creations. Paul speaks this message to the church in Ephesus. He calls them to &ldquo;put off your old nature which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and put on the new nature, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.&rdquo; It ought to be our desires as followers of Jesus to do as he asks, to take up our cross and imitate his example of holiness.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13 c28"><span class="c1">God&rsquo;s purpose for humanity is to be a reflection of his glory in the world. He doesn&rsquo;t do this out of selfishness, wanting more glory, as if He needs to be glorified anymore than He already is. God desires that his glory shine because as it does, his love, grace,and mercies shine. His ultimate desire and plan for the universe is one of love. As a good father, God loves his children and wants good things for them -- to be an ambassador for God is a tremendous gift and great honor. It is for our blessing that he chooses us for his purposes. That prime purpose is to abide in Him, to know the fullness of his character and to reflect his love and light in how we walk.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13 c28"><span class="c1">Believers have a great inheritance from the Father. We are called his children and receive his many blessings. By his grace and goodness, he redeems us by the blood of Jesus and handpicks us to carry out his good works and be a blessing to others. The rewards for faithfulness are plenty in this life alone, notwithstanding an eternity of oneness with the triune God. But we do not obey God begrudgingly, simply waiting for our reward. We do so cheerfully because God loved us first (1 John 4:19). When you come to a full understanding of the good news of Christ, you desire nothing more than to serve him. It is not an easy road, but one we must take even so.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13 c28"><span>Jesus commands everyone who follows him to &ldquo;be perfect&rdquo; (Matt 5:48). At first glance this task looks impossible. How can a sinful person become utterly </span><span>sinless</span><span class="c1">? Paul the Apostle, said to be the greatest Christian to ever lived, struggled with this question. Before God transformed him into that great Apostle, Paul was a Christian killer. So now, as a Christian himself, Paul grappled with the theology of forgiveness since he had done so many wrongs. He cries out in a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!&rdquo; (Romans 7:24-25). Paul attributes his groaning to having a sinful nature. We as well have this inherent nature of sinfulness as mortal creatures. We are filled with wickedness because of our iniquity, and therefore cannot please God. But Paul is hopeful because he is forgiven and no longer worries about moral perfection.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13 c28"><span class="c1">Paul expressed his new understanding of the good news of Jesus in chapter eight: &ldquo;Those controlled by the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you&rdquo; (vss 8-9). Christians are blessed with the indwelling Spirit of God. We are empowered to live in a manner that is pleasing to God. Without God&rsquo;s help, this would be impossible. Indeed, Jesus says, &ldquo;With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible&rdquo; (Matthew 19:&#8203;26). The disciples had asked Jesus how a person can be saved if the standard to enter the kingdom of God is so high. His answer shows us that our salvation is not depended on us but is a promise from God for those who believe.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13 c28"><span class="c1">Abiding in God, then, is not striving against our temptations, fighting to never sin again, but simply to rest in what He has already done. When we are faithful to trust in the name of Jesus, he is faithful to sanctify us into his likeness (2 Corinthians 3:18). So what is it like to become like Christ?</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13 c28"><span class="c1">Scripture uses the word &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; to capture the majesty of who the Lord is. And as we abide, we enter into that fullness. Psalm 24 compares his fullness to the created Earth in all its detail. If you think about it, what are the odds that Earth exists in such harmony? If it were not placed in such an exact distance from the Sun, life would not be possible. If it did not spin at its exact rotation, or if it did not have such a layer of atmospheres. If the Earth were any different than it is, life could not exist. But the Earth did more than that. Because of it&rsquo;s miraculous characteristics, the Earth supports intelligent life. And that&rsquo;s not considering the intricacy of our solar system, our galaxy, or the universe as a whole! Acclaimed physicist and mathematician reflects on this problem, &ldquo;I do not feel like an alien in this universe. The more I examine the universe and the details of its architecture, the more evidence I find that the universe must in some sense have known we were coming.&rdquo; The findings of modern science and the wondrous discoveries of all history suggest a purpose in nature &ldquo;and that in some way we were built into it.&rdquo; Over course, not everyone agrees with his thoughts, nor am I arguing here one way or another. The uniqueness of all of creation and the supernatural circumstances by which they thrive accurately depict the fullness of God.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13 c28"><span class="c1">John 1:16 relates that from his fullness, the whole glory of God in all his goodness, we receive &ldquo;grace upon grace.&rdquo; The purest way God shows his fullness is by his grace toward humanity. Who among us, when wronged by someone else, has as our first thought to show grace? When Adam and Eve rebelled against him in the garden, he could have wiped them out and tried again. Like building a sandcastle, he could have just brushed them away. I imagine I would have if I was in that situation. But we know that God doesn&rsquo;t make mistakes. God knew from the very beginning that we would deny him and muddy his holy name. SImply because he loves us and by the fullness of his majesty and power, has the patience to show grace upon grace as a testimony to his nature.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13 c28"><span class="c1">Ephesians 3:19 speaks of the fullness of God as a product in believers from the love of Christ. This love &ldquo;which surpasses knowledge&rdquo; was expressed by God when Jesus was nailed to the cross on our behalf. He bore the punishment meant for us so that we could be free. By this love, God made a way for his people who are now dead in sin because of their choices to be restored into perfect unity with Him. This action declares his fullness louder than possibly anything else. It is the single most charitable and selfless thing ever to be done. The Bible says that &ldquo;while we were still sinners Christ died for us&rdquo; (Rom 5:8). Or while we were yet his enemies, he died for us. Jesus laid down his life for the very ones who nailed him to that tree. That&rsquo;s me and you whenever we sin. The greatest humanitarians haven&rsquo;t come close to such an extension of love. Truly God&rsquo;s love for his people embodies his fullness. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13 c28"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s absolutely mind-boggling to me that God invites us to enjoy his fullness. Upon the gracious act of salvation, believers are brought into a relationship with God. Colossians 2:10 says that &ldquo;in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority.&rdquo; Jesus offers his fullness to those who will abide in Him. As the fruit is sustained by the tree, so are people meant to find sustenance in Christ. This was the original plan in the Garden of Eden. And it&rsquo;s still meant to be that way. When we abide in Christ and he abides in us, we may experience his power and love in their most potent form -- oneness with God the Father, Son, and Spirit. Therein lies the goal of this study -- to be transformed.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c28"><span class="c20">&ldquo;</span><span class="c16">Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

If Jesus is not who he claimed to be, if he did not defeat death by rising on the third day, then Christians are to be pitied more than any other men. Similarly, if we hope in Christ for personal gain in this life, we are lost (1 Cor 15:12-19). It is of utmost importance that we must check the source and direction of our faith and apply it correctly in life. Our goal as Christians therefore, is to be as like Jesus as possible, to be perfected by his blood (Heb 10:14) and abide in Him as a spiritual offering (Rom 12:1-2).</span></p><p class="c19 c14 c5"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c19 c5"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, &lsquo;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span><span>(John 8:12)</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c60 c74"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">People say that God works in mysterious ways. I suppose it&rsquo;s true, especially concerning the context of Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Romans. In it he discusses the sufferings of humanity and creation in conjunction with God&rsquo;s sovereignty and forbearance. Evil and hardship exist, but God is faithful to help and lead us according to his will, &ldquo;his good, pleasing and perfect will&rdquo; &nbsp;(Romans 12:2). </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">I wrote this book because I needed to. During the COVID pandemic, I was so afraid and angry at the world, I just wanted to rest in his embrace like a baby being cradled. My shame gloomed over me and I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I was so focused on everything wrong in my life and needed a wake up call. God gave me the idea for this book one night while I was crying out to him for help. He said you already know the answer, you know to find peace from your anxieties -- abide in me as I abide in you, he said.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">I started thinking about that word, &ldquo;Abide,&rdquo; and what it really meant. I thought of The Big Lebowski and his catchphrase, &ldquo;the dude abides.&rdquo; That wasn&rsquo;t it. I thought of how citizens abide by the law. That wasn&rsquo;t it. My imagination stretched a little and I thought of how paint abides with the wall. But that image didn&rsquo;t offer truth either. Then I remembered Jesus&rsquo; story about the vine and the vinedresser. For reference you can turn to John 15:1-11. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">He uses a metaphor about a tree and its branches to explain the source of our life and spiritual growth. In verse 5, he says, &ldquo;I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing,&rdquo; Aha! I said. Abiding is so much more than obeying, being passive, or dwelling with as the dictionary suggests. With God, abiding is to find one&rsquo;s entire self in the supplication of his Spirit. Like an apple tree, the branches can&rsquo;t produce fruit if they are not closely connected to the tree and its roots. The Christian cannot experience the fullness of his grace and peace nor do anything that honors God without being firmly rooted in Him.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">When I was a young man, about 16, I was diagnosed with cancer and a terminal infection. A few months prior my mother passed away, enduring many types of cancer since I was very little. She was my hero and when she died, everything seemed to fall apart. And then getting sick myself so soon after, it looked like God was absent. But for the six months I spent in the hospital and another year and a half of treatment, God showed me the depths of his faithfulness.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">The doctors told my father that I wouldn&rsquo;t live. He said there was a complication with a surgery and I contracted a deadly bacterial infection in my brain and spine. He said there was no hope.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">But God in his sovereignty knew the end of the story. During that time in the hospital, God taught me how to abide in Him. He taught me to trust him even when else fails. He taught me to remain joyful amidst hardship and to look to Christ Jesus as my goal. He showed me who he is, that when I am weak, &nbsp;he is strong. &nbsp;God becomes your strength when you lean on him in Jesus Christ alone. &nbsp;And I suppose that&#39;s what this book is about, learning how to abide in Christ and be transformed by discovering truth and living sacrificially.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.feodq5p3sihs"><span class="c16">Good News!</span></h3><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">The book of John teaches, &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God&quot; (3:16-18). God desired to be restored to us so much so that he gave up what was most precious to Him so that we might be saved from a punishment we fully deserved. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Paul adds in Romans, &quot;but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us&quot; (5:8). Verse 10 emphasizes how we were enemies of God! And he paid the price for us anyway! Never before has something so miraculous happened! Humanity is cursed by the power, presence, and eternal punishment for evil. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">This is the result of our disobedience against God. But God does not tolerate evil, so he threw humanity out of the Garden of Eden and into the world where there is all kinds of suffering and sadness. Now without God, we are doomed. Not only life a burdened life on the Earth but to exist in eternal torment in Hell. This is the fate of all humankind. So even though we are evil and enemies of God, without hope and without excuse, he of his own accord wanted so badly to be reunited with us that he opened a way for us to be redeemed.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">But according to the law of God which he gave to the Hebrews, &ldquo;there can be no forgiveness without the shedding of blood&rdquo; (Heb 9:22). God is a just God and cannot break his own laws. And no simply animal sacrifice would work, as people did in the Old Testament to temporarily cover their wickedness. We needed a miracle. Nothing short of that could save us from our eternal doom. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Can you imagine the resounding joy in the crowds when Jesus came to Jerusalem on Palm Sunday and everyone shouted, &ldquo;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!&rdquo; (John 12:13). Because they called him &ldquo;King of Israel,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s thought that they expected Jesus, the Messiah, to be a political deliverer and free the Jews from Roman oppression. But he came to save us eternally, not temporarily. There are so many instances in the gospels where Jesus stands on his authority over evil and death and forgives people&rsquo;s sins. And most vividly, on the moment of Jesus death, when something happened in the temple: &ldquo;And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom&rdquo; (Matt 27:51).</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">The veil was a barrier in the temple between the presence of God and the people. Long story short, the sacrifice God paid on our behalf severed that chain and made a way for us to approach God and be restored as if still in the garden! To be freed from sin and doom and be brought into new life forever!!!!!!!!!</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">But knowing this good news as so many of us already do is not enough. This is why I&rsquo;m writing this book: to document my own journey and to help others find transformation in the light of the Son. Just like being aware of a box of bandaids in the drawer isn&rsquo;t enough to cover a boo-boo, we must respond to our need for forgiveness and seek Christ first, above all else (Matt 6:33).</span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Forgiveness and eternal life in Heaven are not given to us freely. These came at an insurmountable cost; the life of God&rsquo;s own son and very being. Even though we couldn&rsquo;t possibly repay God for his kindness, he does expect something from us. When Jesus was a young man, he &ldquo;went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. &lsquo;The time has come,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!&rsquo;&rdquo; His message is for us as well, so many years after. Repent and believe!</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Paul gives a long exhortation about what it looks like to repent and believe (Rom 8:1-17). He describes all people as fitting into two categories, those with the mind of flesh and those with the mind of the Spirit: People who set their minds on what the body desires and people who set their minds on what the Spirit desires (vs 5). The end result of these desires, Paul concludes, are death and life respectively. Only by trusting in the redemptive power of Jesus does the Spirit give life (vs 11). Because of this gift, we have a duty in life: &ldquo;but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it&rdquo; (vs 12b).</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span>This pushed me toward a study identifying the desires of the flesh and Spirit and what the Bible says they produce. For instance, desire for wealth and luxury makes one dependent on such things and creates gaping holes in a person when they&rsquo;re not readily available. Consider the link between econmic recession and suicide. This is why it says in 1 Tim 6:10 that the love of money and greediness &ldquo;pierces&rdquo; the person &ldquo;with many sorrows.&rdquo; It is the root of all evil because it encourages the person to think and do things contrary to their own well-being. Consider even the person of great economic fortune. They are often under such stress that there is no room for happiness</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c1">; identity based on gain logically leads one to never being satisfied with what one has. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span>Scripture narrows down the product of every desire of the flesh. Adversely are the products of desiring the Spirit as seen below. To abide in Christ we must abandon the desires of the flesh and seek after the Spirit: </span><span>&ldquo;O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness&rdquo; (vs 11). The mind of flesh is overwhelmed with darkness; it it there is no light. But by the gracious Spirit of God, faith cures our fear, hope enlights our shame, joy overwhelms all anger and so on and so forth. Let this be the starting point for study. We cannot abide in Christ if we are held prisoner by the mind of flesh.<br></span></p><a id="t.b80dde937bb474f7640d02de39b46a173a2fb241"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c33"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c9 c59" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c10">Mind of Flesh</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Mind of the Spirit</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9 c59" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c10">Fear</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c25 c49">Romans 8:15</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Faith</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c31 c25">Hebrews 11:1</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9 c59" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c10">Shame</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c49 c25">Romans 6:21</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Hope</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c31 c25">Ephesians 1:18</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9 c59" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c10">Anger</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c49 c25">Psalm 37:8</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Joy</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c31 c25">1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9 c59" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c10">Pride</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c49 c25">Proverbs 8:13</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Humility</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c31 c25">1 Peter 5:5</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9 c59" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c10">Strife</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c49 c25">Proverbs 10:12</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Peace</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c31 c25">John 14:27</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9 c59" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c10">Lust</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c49 c25">1 John 2:16</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Love</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c31 c25">Matthew 22:34-40</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Are you still living in the flesh according to the desires of your heart? Or do you belong to Christ and now live a new life in the Spirit? Jesus says that you will know them by their fruits. Are you more faithful, hopeful, joyful, humble, peaceable, and loving? If there is anything in you that is holding onto fear, shame, anger, pride, hatred, or lust, do all you can to purge yourself and put on Christlikeness -- &ldquo;this is your true and proper worship&rdquo; (Rom 12:1-2)</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span>Paul, one of the most persecuted and forlorn Christians mentioned in the Bible, declared with certainty, </span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&ldquo;I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength&rdquo; (Phillipians 4:12b-13). Do you live everyday like Paul, looking to God for strength? Or are you so torn with self-pity that you see yourself as the victim? Vulnerability before God is vital! Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to make excuses as I have for so long.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">As a side note, &ldquo;But God&rdquo; is likely the greatest transitional expression in all of the Bible. Follow the thought of this passage:</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience&mdash; &nbsp;among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.&rdquo; (Eph 2:1-3)</span></p><p class="c2 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Not a very nice picture of humanity, is it? Doesn&rsquo;t offer much hope, does it? Now look at the next verses:</span></p><p class="c2 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ&mdash;by grace you have been saved&rdquo; &nbsp;(Eph 2:4-5)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But God&rdquo; is everything for the believer. It&rsquo;s not like we were drowning and God gave us a raft to climb on. No, we were at the bottom of the ocean floor, DROWNED, dead as dust. But God, rich in mercy, love and grace, offers us life: </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed&rdquo; (Isa 53:5)</span></p><p class="c6 c50 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But God proves His love for us in this: While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&rdquo; (Rom 5:8)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But God, being rich in mercy, gave up his son, knowing full well that the very one&rsquo;s he&rsquo;d die to forgive would torture and kill him! He sought to satisfy justice and put away sin once and for all. It is a moment of tragic irony-- that the Messiah, the one the Jews were waiting for, the only one able to take away our iniquity, would die by the same sinner&rsquo;s hands. And I&rsquo;m not so sure it would be any different if you or I were instead of the people that condemned him. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we rejoice at the cross, it is forgiveness! This is why we rejoice at the empty tomb, it is freedom! Jesus is everything for the believer, and stands as our inspiration for living radically and carrying out the great commission. Without Christ, the cross, and the empty tomb, there is no hope. Without God&rsquo;s great forbearance in sending his son, there is no life for anyone. Without Jesus, we are nothing. This is why we love Jesus, why we praise him and thank him for hours and hours! Recognize this: without Jesus, there is only death. We would not have forgiveness and so, would all be condemned to an eternity of suffering in Hell. So take a moment to thank God for Jesus!</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Before I came to a place of peace and rest in God&rsquo;s promises, bitterness consumed me. I was blinded to the rich life God offered. I knew God, but holding onto sin kept me from experiencing his fullness. I was in love with thinking myself a victim. I was in love with the darkness of pride and was therefore dead. But God! Being rich in mercy! O Lord, how great is your name in all the Earth! I&rsquo;m so thankful for his mercy and grace! God raised me to new life physically by curing my cancer and infections. Exponentially more important, he gave me new life in the spirit. Jesus became the propitiation for you and for me! He shines like the sun in his radiance and glory! Where sin and death once reigned, Christ is king.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">The doctors, my family and myself only saw the one outcome. We were all like children, nearsighted and ignorant. Thankfully God looks through a different lens. He is our good Father and knows what we need. Oftentimes we tell him the things we want, thinking they are essential. At the time I asked God to save me from my cancer when what I really needed was for him to save me from my sin. It&rsquo;s not just a three letter word, it&rsquo;s an impassable barrier between myself and God and only by the blood of Jesus am I forgiven and am now able to approach the throne of God&rsquo;s grace and innumerable blessings. Thank you Lord for my cancer, for it brought me to a place where I could understand the depths of my sin and my great need for your saving grace!</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Yes God healed me from my cancer. Yes he blessed me with life. But how much greater is the blessing of being forgiven! To be united with God by the blood of Jesus! All I can say is thank you, Lord, because there&rsquo;s nothing in me that is worthy! &ldquo;O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank God&mdash;through Jesus Christ our Lord!&rdquo; (Rom 7:24-25). This is why I say it&rsquo;s all about Jesus! This is why the world needs Jesus! This is the climax of all history! This is why he is more than enough! Whatever you&rsquo;re looking for in life, Jesus is more. Whatever you&rsquo;re lacking, Jesus is enough. So walk with me through an in-depth examination of our hearts before God and seek to put off the old self which is rotten with sin and put on the righteousness of Jesus Christ that saves. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">What follows is a series of self-inspections. To be transformed our minds must be renewed, as Romans 12:2 teaches. To be transformed we need to let the Holy Spirit flow through us by putting away fear, shame, anger, pride, and all sin. And walk in the newness of life by Jesus&rsquo; example, faith, hope, joy, humility, and love above all. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">The first and in my opinion, the most formidable enemy to following after Christ, is fear, our starting point to being transformed.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c2 c29 c63" id="h.vhlx9zdgtmak"><span class="c15"></span></h2><h2 class="c2 c29" id="h.4s58ybiet9je"><span>Chapter Two : Fear</span></h2><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s strange how normal things like a washing machine can be terrifying to a little child. </span><span class="c5">Fear transforms simple things into dangerous monsters, even for adults! Why do people jump out of their skin when they see a spider? Odds are high that it&rsquo;s not aiming to hurt you, nor can it. But for some reason they&rsquo;re a source of great fear. Simply put, &ldquo;f</span><span class="c5">ear is an uneasiness of mind, upon the thought of future harm likely to befall us. Fear is the passion of our nature which excites us to provide for our security, on the approach of evil.&rdquo; </span><sup class="c5"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;It, however, has no place in our lives because of Christ.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c5">The Lord is my light and my salvation&mdash; whom shall I fear?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c5">The Lord is the stronghold of my life&mdash; of whom shall I be afraid?&rdquo; &nbsp;(Psalm 27:1)</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1 c5">A famous study from 1973 conducted by R.H. Bruskin Associates found that American&rsquo;s fear public speaking more than death. The subjects of their survey would rather die than give a presentation! That is the crippling effect of fear. The pressure of public speaking overwhelmed these people so intensely and likely clouded their judgement, because I don&rsquo;t think a person, if presented the task of presenting in front of a crowd, would really rather die. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;Right now in this time of Covid 19 fear plagues the entire world. Thankfully we have the vaccines now, but just a few months ago, the news was ablaze with violent warnings. Stay inside! Don&rsquo;t go out! Be afraid, be very afraid! Fear drove us to attack each other. Social media blew up with arguments and discord, blame shifting and name calling. Whatever your stance on the matter, it stands that fear has power, especially when there is little understanding.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">This makes me think of that scene in Home Alone where Kevin goes into the basement and sees the furnace. In his imaginings, it&rsquo;s malicious and alive. It growls and roars at him and becomes a great threat. Later in the movie, he confronts his fear and finds that the furnace is nothing more than just that. Not all of our fears are so easily thwarted, however the solution is the same. If we frame our fears in the truth of God&rsquo;s sovereignty, they cannot stand. In the light of the Son, darkness cannot stand (John 1:5). Confront your fears, give them no power by acknowledging </span><span class="c5">his</span><span class="c1 c5">.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">How do we do this exactly? A lot of times the deep things of life are impossible to understand fully, especially the depths of the mind. And fear is so widespread! A study conducted with Chapman University to discover the most common fears in America found that &ldquo;In 2018 and 2019, all the top ten fears were held by more than half of Americans. There has been a noticeable increase in people who share these fears. The study concludes, &ldquo;Americans are becoming more afraid </span><sup class="c5"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c5">.&rdquo; I can only assume the percentages have gotten worse with the rise of COVID and isolation. And not only so! According to a 2021 study by Mental Health America, people are reaching out for help with anxiety and depression more than ever. Of all the groups surveyed, young people ages 11-17 ranked highest for moderate to severe symptoms </span><sup class="c5"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c1 c5">. Contributing factors are the COVID virus, money concerns, and the top factor, deprivation of social interaction: &ldquo;From April to September 2020, among people who screened with moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression, 70 percent reported that one of the top three things contributing to their mental health concerns was loneliness or isolation,&rdquo; myself included!</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1 c5">When she was alive, my mother was my hero. She was my foundation and stood in the place of my heart only God deserves. So whenever her condition relapsed, fear of losing her drove me mad. Fear of being left alone kept me bound. There were many times when suicide crossed my mind, thankfully (and ironically), I was too afraid to go through with it. That anxiety stayed with me long after she died, manifesting primarily in prolonged isolation and nightmares. I was participating in church, even serving in youth ministry during those years, and nothing seemed to help. I was sans help, helpless even, to live the fearless life I was called by God to live.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">This is a hard truth to swallow: when we fear, we sin against God. Jesus said, &ldquo;Be anxious for nothing!&rdquo; This is a command. When we submit to our fears and worries instead of God, we are in direct disobedience. And sinful fear creates sinful worship. If I&rsquo;m afraid of heights (which I am), I&rsquo;m bowing to the power of my fear instead of resting in Him. If I&rsquo;m uneasy around big dogs (which I am), I&rsquo;m letting my fear get the best of me. 2 Timothy 1:7 teaches, &ldquo;God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.&rdquo; When I&rsquo;m afraid, I deny the spirit God gave me.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">I remember so many times when I was tempted to fear in the hospital. Like I said, I was there for six months, and feelings of powerlessness loomed in my room all of the time. I remember feeling caged by uncertainty. But God did not give me a spirit of fear. God did not put me in that place to wallow in self-pity or to cast blame on the hospital for letting me get that deadly infection. Simply put, God put me there for an eternal reason: to get my heart submitted to him and to be a testimony to others of his faithfulness.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Beware of being caged by your fears.

He talks about a man who grabbed a snake off of the ground and put it in a jar as a trophy. He later discovered that this particular species of snake is very poisonous and nearly had a heart attack (p. 14-15). In order for a fear to present a legitimate threat, &nbsp;it must possess two qualities: immanency (nearness) and potency (powerful). Our fears are no longer legitimate when one of these attributes is removed. Scripture teaches that we have no need to fear because God removes one of these attributes. For example, the reality of death is imminent, but the power of death has been broken (1 Cor 15:54-55) (Neil Anderson, 1999, p. 14; 15; 16). When truth is applied, fear disappears. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 262.50px; height: 252.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 262.50px; height: 252.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span>I am not afraid of drowning, nor of bears, nor any danger around me because I&rsquo;m not afraid of being hurt or killed. </span><span class="c20">This DOES NOT mean</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I have no understanding of the danger or run to it. To fear is to obsess irrationally and give the object power over your peace. To have caution is to have a healthy awareness of our surroundings and any present danger, maintaining control. I don&rsquo;t think the man in the story would have picked up the snake had he known it was poisonous. Had he had caution, he would have avoided the snake and fear would not have taken root. Most of our fears revolve around things we can&rsquo;t control. Trust God, who is in control of all things at all times, and there is no need to be afraid of anything!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1 c5">The truth of scripture understands fear as a matter of submitting. It is a sin to be controlled by fear because in doing so, we worship something else. People fear living without, so they worship money. We fear not being accepted, not being beautiful enough or successful enough, so we idolize celebrities, magazine models, and people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. We fear creepy crawlies and other scary things because we do not fully understand God&rsquo;s design and so idolize our own preferences. Do you think Adam and Eve were scared of the carnivorous beasts and harmful plants around them? Of course not, because they knew that God was with them and everything he made was good. To have a correct perspective, we must change our thinking on such things. Romans 12:1-2, famous passage, says, &ldquo;Do not conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind so that you may test and approve what is the will of God, what is good, pleasing and perfect.&rdquo; Reorienting one&rsquo;s fears in light of God&rsquo;s presence and the amazing gift of his son Jesus brings salvation and healing and is the first step to transformation. Unholy fear manifested horrors in me; it&rsquo;s power was terrible. It will take charge over your life, but only if you let it. But God (there&rsquo;s that transitional expression again!) used that fear for a purpose in my life, and I believe he can do the same for you. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c20">Wor</span><span class="c16 c5">ldly Fear creates Sinful Worship</span></p><a id="t.8983938992b1917f7c2cf2921ad2a3425b0dae75"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c51"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16 c5">FEAR</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16 c5">IDOLS</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">People</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">Approval</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">Hardship</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">The Easy Life</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">Loss</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">Money, Things, Loved Ones</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">Pain and Suffering</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">Safety</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">Conflict</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1 c5">Peace</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29 c13" id="h.dpnd36i9blmp"><span class="c16">Fighting the Enemy</span></h3><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c42"></span></p><p class="c2 c13"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble in dread before them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you.

It is nothing physical that we war against as Christians. We do not fight against each other or against the world, &ldquo;but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places&rdquo; (Eph 6:12), against Satan, the ruler and prince of this world. His purpose is singular, to get in the way of God&rsquo;s plans by hindering the Church. His primary method of attack is lies (John 8:44) and he will continue to do so until his inevitable defeat at the end of the age (</span><span class="c1">Rev 20:7-10).</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">We know from scripture that God is sovereign over everything, including the devil. We know from scripture that the only reason Satan still threatens us is because God allows it (Job 1:6-12), because that&rsquo;s what humanity chose instead of God (Gen 3). And so, because of the reality presented to us upon birth, we as a church have a decision to make. Sin, temptation, evil desires, lies, etc. exist, however much we may not want them to. Will we submit to them and live as the rest of the world does, for the fleeting moment? Or will we endure hardship and fight for the sake of knowing God and being made into the likeness of Christ for an eternal dwelling?</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Be alert and of sober mind.

Notice how they can all be reworded as &ldquo;What if&rdquo; statements. And notice also how the worries can honor God if we place them in his hands. He desires that we share our burdens with him. He is there to comfort and guide us. Psalm 55: 22 instructs, &ldquo;Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">In every trial let us call upon the Lord, and he will save us. To cast our burden upon God is to rest in his sovereign promises. And when we choose, instead of fearing, to trust God, he is faithful to sustain us amidst the most terrible struggle. He will impart to our spirits the strength and perfection of his divine Spirit so that we may glorify him as image bearers. As redeemed Christians, we are Christ&rsquo;s ambassadors and ought to live our lives in remembrance of him. &ldquo;He will never suffer the righteous to be moved, to be so shaken by trials as to forget their duty to God or their comfort in him. He will not suffer them to be utterly cast down. He, who bore the burden of our sorrows, desires us to leave to him to bear the burden of our cares, that, as he knows what is best for us, may provide it accordingly.&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="c24 c29 c85" id="h.oklfjppsi33i"><span>Fear God Who is Eternal, not the Temporary World</span></h3><p class="c2 c14 c13"><span class="c20 c74 c95"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span>Irrational fears, the ones we discussed above, are never good. But fear can be a good thing, when rightly understood. See what Jesus says, speaking to his twelve disciples,</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c13"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father&rsquo;s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don&rsquo;t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows&rdquo; (Matt 10:28-31) </span></p><p class="c36 c24 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c13"><span class="c1">In Jesus&rsquo; time, sparrows had little cultural importance and were a cheap source of food for poor families. </span></p><p class="c36 c24 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c13"><span class="c1">Luke reiterates Jesus&rsquo; words in 12:4-7: &ldquo;I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do. But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him! Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than sparrows.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c36 c24 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c13"><span class="c1">The point remains, if God cares so deeply about a little bird with little worth, how much more so will God take care of you, his most prized creation! So don&rsquo;t consider the sparrows of the world a threat to your livelihood, but consider the one who created them and intended them for a purpose, who created you and intended an eternal life for you! Do not choose eternal death by following after the sparrows!</span></p><p class="c36 c24 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c13"><span class="c1">To fear God is not to be afraid of him. It is simply to acknowledge him for who he truly is.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1 c5">There are so many instances in scripture where fear of the Lord imparts blessing and wisdom to those who have it. So what is it, really? Because we have such a negative connotation of fear, it can be hard to attribute it to a loving God. Fearing God doesn&rsquo;t mean we fear him like we do darkness, spiders, or other scary things. I think it means three things: </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c20 c5">(1)</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;It means that we acknowledge who he is as the Alpha and Omega, creator of the universe, omnipotent and omnipresent. Revelation 1:17 reads. &ldquo;When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. He put his right hand on me and said, &lsquo;Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c20 c5">(2)</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;It also means that we acknowledge who we are as sinners who deserve only his wrath because of our disobedience. &ldquo;But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death&rdquo; (Revelation 21:8). </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">And </span><span class="c20 c5">(3)</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;it reflects our genuine appreciation of his grace because of this discrepancy. The Bible says that &ldquo;while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&rdquo; Another way to interpret this is, &lsquo;while we were yet his enemies.&rsquo; God gave us everything, even when we deserved the exact opposite! So rejoice! Be thankful for his amazing grace! Yahoo! I&rsquo;m forgiven! Thank you Jesus! </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">In our culture, we see everything from a point of legal rights. As a citizen, I feel I have the right to a lot of things which in reality, I don&rsquo;t. I have the right to a fair trial. Try and tell that to marginalized communities. I have the right to express my opinions. Not in </span><span class="c5">this cancel culture</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t. I am endowed with natural rights like the right to own property and the right to question the government. Think about all the small businesses that have been shut down for not conforming against their religious beliefs. We are so quick to judge that too often rights are infringed on. And too often do we bring this sense of &ldquo;I deserve better&rdquo; into God&rsquo;s economy. Because of our national rights, we assume God gives us rights as well, and when things don&#39;t go our way we complain and blame God. </span><span class="c20 c5">We can&rsquo;t possibly understand his unrequited love with a legalistic frame of mind!</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;This is fear of hardship, not fear of God. This is worshiping selfish expectations, not submitting to God&rsquo;s &ldquo;good, perfect, and pleasing&rdquo; will. And you say again, &ldquo;How is hardship &lsquo;good, perfect, and pleasing?&rsquo; Obey God, wait it out, and you&rsquo;ll see! God did not create you to have an easy life. He created you to glorify Him by living the set apart life, and we&rsquo;ll get into that in the third section later in the book. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Remember in the Old Testament the many steps the Israelites needed to take before they could approach God? Remember the complicated sacrifices they had to make to cover their sins? Remember how the glory of God instilled fear in their hearts? They did not take his holy presence lightly and had a clear understanding of his great mercy and his wrath against unrepentant sin. God is a god of love AND justice. Fear of the Lord acknowledges his deity; take heed, lest we forget and lose our way. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">Jesus warns near the end of his sermon on the mount, &ldquo;Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it&rdquo; (Matt 7:13-14), and again a few verses later, &ldquo;Not everyone who says to me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven (Matt 7:21). Here he reminds us of the severity of God&rsquo;s command to be righteous, to walk through life as reflections of his glory. I was listening to a pastor on the radio the other day and he was talking about the kingdom of God as represented in revelation, how the city is built with the purest gold, onyx, diamond, topaz, emerald, jasper. And how the glory of God reflected off of them with unimaginable magnificence. He talked about how people are like those jewels, that the light of God&rsquo;s glory is refracted through us into knowable colors, godly characteristics. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into His image with intensifying glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor 3:17)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1">I wonder, what is the shade of God&rsquo;s glory in you? Is it bright and clearly visible, or is it dim or maybe even transparent? Do you have a right fear of the Lord so as to honor and obey him and glorify him?</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">Fear of the Lord is undeniable proof that you are set apart as his. It is holy and does away with sin. Fear of God is rightly revering his authority and power. We fear his wrath against sin; we love his saving grace. And so we submit to His will and keep his commandments. Rather than give power to death, danger, discomfort or uncertainty, we give it to whom it is properly due, to the one who is able to deliver us from all of these things. </span><span class="c1">In short, the fear of God is to fear nothing else.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c41 c24 c13"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>God&rsquo;s fear is properly in men&rsquo;s hearts; but here the sense seems to be this, that this fear, i.e. his dreadful manifestation of his majesty and justice, (the act being here put for the object,) may be now and ever before your eyes, and in your memories, as an effectual preservative from sin.&rdquo; </span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1 c5">By this commentary, we can better understand what the fear of the Lord does: it preserves us from sinful worldly fear! And even this, that many of my fears can become joys! As in suffering for the building up of God&rsquo;s kingdom or denying myself to love others better. Because I no longer fear death or pain or rejection, I can boldly proclaim the good news of Jesus with boldness! I can serve God behind the scenes with an unsurpassed sense of fulfillment. Fear of missing out no longer directs my choices: I can now spend my whole day reading the Bible and praying and enjoy the far richer blessing of communing with God, even though I could be watching TV or hanging out with friends. It is now my greatest joy to serve God, whereas before I would serve myself and my own desires. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">&ldquo;When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.&quot; &nbsp;(</span><span class="c5"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/56-3.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1629233819051000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2N88qZrxgPLaSdopkEy26y">Psalm 56:3</a></span><span class="c1 c5">)</span></p><p class="c2 c14 c13"><span class="c31 c25 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1 c5">Through my earthly fears, God revealed my deep weaknesses and great need for Christ. By renewing my thinking (Rom 12:1) with believing in the power of Jesus&rsquo; death, burial and resurrection, studying the Bible, prayer, and fellowship with the saints, God transformed my heart and mind from life in the flesh to life in the Spirit and obliterated my fears. Because of his grace and perseverance working in me, I have the power to choose boldness and put away fear.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1 c5">My prayer for you is that you would see God more fully in the scriptures. That He would impart wisdom and discernment to you, and that your worldly fears would be replaced with fear of the Lord.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1 c5">I remember trying to read the Bible in my youth, loving the stories and famous passages but loathing the law and the prophets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so boring! Where&rsquo;s the action? Give me David and Goliath! Give me Noah&rsquo;s Ark!&rdquo; Now having a better understanding of the entirety of scripture, those boring passages have come to light! Jesus is the fulfillment of all scripture and his presence is clearly seen in every chapter. The author and perfecter of our faith, the climax of the Bible and the hero of the story appears even in the Old Testament laws about food. Christ&rsquo;s death, burial and resurrection met the letter of the law for all people, past, present, and future. Now because of the Son, God sees us as sinless, perfect creatures! This is not an excuse to continue sinning, but what relief! Because of Jesus, I am not held accountable for my sin nature but am given a new nature that exudes light and life! So be anxious for nothing! Do not be afraid of death, for it is the gateway to eternal life with God! Do not be afraid of suffering, for it is the means of so many spiritual blessings! Don&rsquo;t worry about tomorrow but trust in God&rsquo;s many perfect promises!</span></p><p class="c2 c14 c13"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? &hellip; Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

Let your reasonableness be known to everyone, the Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.

And though the difference is subtle and often missed, they do have distinct meanings. To experience guilt is to be held responsible. It is a legal term that locates the action of misdemeanor onto a specific person. To feel shame is to bemoan and deplore one&rsquo;s self, not necessarily his or her actions. It is the painful feeling caused by awareness of wrong behavior. The two words are closely linked-- shame typically follows guilt. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine you are driving and a police officer pulls you over for speeding? When the officer explains the nature of your grievance, do you say, &ldquo;Yeah, you got me. I&rsquo;m guilty.&rdquo;? Or do you try to weasel your way out of a ticket? We are not so quick to hold ourselves accountable. Only after you receive the ticket do we admit, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone past the speed limit!&rdquo; Depending on the strength of your conscience, you may guilt-trip yourself for bad behavior, but usually the regret doesn&rsquo;t come until after we&rsquo;ve been proven guilty. No one feels ashamed of something they didn&rsquo;t do. In fact a person is likely to get offended if you accuse them unjustly for that very reason.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of our sin against God, it is all too easy to get caught in a loop of shame. Knowing the depths of my sin is a shoo-in for spiraling self-blame and condemnation. Not only that, but also that it is because of my own personal sin that Jesus had to suffer and die on a cross. My guiltiness before the throne brings me to my knees. And if I stop there, it is hopeless! Isaiah, the Psalmist, and Paul personally feel the weight of their imperfection, and the guilt is deep:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.3de8a3f7dc4e4e617ce904ec8b477ef056b66a74"></a><a id="t.2"></a><table class="c33"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c39" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Woe is me, for I am undone!

So many live in countries that violently oppress their citizens. North Korea is notorious for how ruthlessly it tortures its people. Its many prison camps alone are enough to raise the most indifferent souls to alarming concern </span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>. Not to mention withholding basic needs like food and personal freedoms, even the most basic right to life is threatened by public executions! </span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Those of us living in America can hardly imagine this kind of political persecution. We may be bold enough to say we experience it slightly, but never to that degree!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, God offers an eternal solution that is not focused on the suffering we experience during this short lifetime, but during the great expansions of eternity! God offers freedom from the penalty of sin and eternal suffering in Hell (a legally just punishment for any sinner). Out of his goodness and love for his people, (you know the story), God gave us his son to be punished on our behalf. &nbsp;Because of this, and in keeping with the topic, we no longer need to bear the burden of sin nor guilt nor shame nor doubt. The simple truth is Jesus already did it for us. We no longer have to worry. I realize this isn&rsquo;t as easy to practice as it is to say. We must relearn it everyday, lest we fall into the category below:</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c31 c25"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness&hellip; But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins&rdquo; (2 Peter 1:3; 9)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &ldquo;them&rdquo; Peter identifies are qualities of the growing Christian (2 Peter 1:5-8). Have we lost our way so badly, are we so nearsighted and blind that we have forgotten the great sacrifice of Jesus and the power of God to forgive our sins? Are we so caught in the power of shame that we&rsquo;ve lost our identity in Christ and now place it in our sins? I know from personal experience how easy it is to fall into legalism and hold ourselves harshly accountable for past sins, especially habitual sins that are challenging to get rid of. How arrogant am I to say God is not able to forgive me! That was the depth of my shame and its malevolent power! It was so potent in my reflections that I limited God&rsquo;s power. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember one of the first students I had as a volunteer youth teacher came to me so upset about his inability to live perfectly according to God&rsquo;s commandments. He was so distressed; he couldn&rsquo;t understand how God could change his heart, or forgive him at all! This kind of shame is debilitating to your faith. Imagine how Adam and Eve must have felt! Instead of running to God as children, Adam said, &ldquo;I was afraid, because I was naked.&rdquo; (Gen 3:10b). When our sins and shortcomings are revealed, it does feel like we are defenseless, naked like they were. Think about how it must&rsquo;ve felt to be kicked out of paradise, how you would loathe yourself for sinning against God! If only you could go back and have a do over! </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or think about how Peter felt after denying Jesus three times. On the night of Jesus&rsquo; betrayal, Peter promises that he would lay his life before betraying his Lord (John 13:37). Later that very night, as Peter is accused of being one of the disciples, he does the opposite of standing up for Jesus. He does not lay down his life, but denies any and all association with Jesus. He is more afraid for his own well-being than for his so-called &lsquo;Lord.&rsquo; But unlike the story of Adam and Eve as told in the Bible, Peter grew to understand the power of God&rsquo;s grace. Though Peter most likely lived with great shame for selling out his Savior, God still had a purpose for him. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jesus returned after being crucified, he came to Peter: &lsquo;&ldquo;He said to him the third time, &lsquo;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&rsquo; Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, &lsquo;Do you love me?&rsquo; and he said to him, &lsquo;Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.&rsquo; Jesus said to him, &lsquo;Feed my sheep&rsquo;&rdquo; (John 21:17). Just because we hold onto guilt, that doesn&rsquo;t mean God holds judgement against us. He is faithful to forgive if we would be honest and humble before him.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus is the ultimate example for Christians to follow. Not just in his holiness, but how he fought against temptations to sin. We read in Matthew 4:1 that he was led by the Spirit, of whom he was full, to be tempted in the desert. Famous theologian and philosopher Thomas Aquinas reasons he did so for four reasons. His first three reasons are to strengthen us against temptations, to be warned against temptations, and to teach us how to overcome temptation, and fourthly, to fill us with confidence in his mercy.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jesus is our example and inspiration for holy living.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebrews 4:15 confirms, &quot;We have not a high-priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.&quot; God does not look down at his children, not even the worst of us, with contempt or remorse, wishing us never to have been born. He loves us unconditionally and is faithful to sanctify and perfect us in our faith. On the other hand, free will dictates that the burden is on you to choose. God opened the door by opening your eyes, now you have to walk through.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm you calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall&rdquo; (2 Peter 1:10)</span></p><h3 class="c24 c29 c38" id="h.vk2de0zcw5gn"><span class="c16">Freedom is a Verb</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s said that you can lead an animal to water but you can&rsquo;t make it drink. In order to experience true unity with the Father and like-mindedness with the Son and Spirit, we must be vulnerable and submit before the cross in all humility! Holding on to shame is holding onto doubt. When I told Matt about the shame I held onto because of how I offended him, he taught me about vulnerability and the great power in forgiving one&rsquo;s self. This might simply be new age philosophy, but I think it&rsquo;s very applicable to the topic. The Bible never speaks directly about forgiving yourself, only about trusting in Jesus&rsquo; sacrifice on the cross for forgiveness and the command to forgive others. What it really comes down to is do I trust God? Do I trust his plans for my life?</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excerpt from Baker&rsquo;s Dictionary of Theology reads, &ldquo;The New Testament deepens and expands the concept of shame. A disciple of Christ stands with him unashamedly in a world that finds the cross (Heb 12:2), God&#39;s ways (1 Cor 1:27), and God&#39;s persecuted messengers (2 Timothy 1:8; 1:12) shameful. Those ashamed of him now will find Christ ashamed of them on the day of judgment (Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26). Conversely, God is not ashamed to call the faithful &quot;brothers&quot; of Christ (Heb 2:11).&rdquo; </span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the cross, our worldly shames are taken care of. At the cross, we put on a new type-- we stand united with Christ wholly unashamed. Shame of sin is cast on the Lord who is faithful to bear the weight of all our burdens. And we go unto the world, unashamedly sharing his love with others.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask yourself: Do I trust God enough to stand naked before him, showing all of my weaknesses and shames? Am I too ashamed to pick up my cross and follow Jesus&rsquo; example? Do I love God enough to do what he commands, despite my many weaknesses? Will I continue to serve God even when the world turns it&rsquo;s back on me and looks down at me with shame? </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read Paul&rsquo;s epistles, I&rsquo;m overwhelmed with the grace of God. When I read James, I&rsquo;m overwhelmed with responsibility. Paul often opens his letters by identifying himself as an apostle on a mission. He blesses the churches with grace, peace and mercy from God the father and Christ Jesus. James starts his letter identifying himself as a slave and servant of God and of Christ. He encourages his readers to welcome trials and sufferings as a means to test one&rsquo;s faith and so produce steadfastness which , in its full effect, makes one &ldquo;perfect and complete, lacking in nothing&rdquo; (Jam 1:4). </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two views are sides of the same coin. Yes, we must rely heavily on God&rsquo;s grace, peace, and mercy! Yes, we must take responsibility for our faith! Yes, no one is saved by works alone but only by the blood of Jesus are we forgiven and so have entrance into the kingdom of God. Yes, works confirm our salvation and as ambassadors, we honor God by living righteously. I don&rsquo;t know that any of us are able to stand when things get rough, only by his power and mercy are any of us still alive! Neither do I know any bible believing Christian who is content to go live atop a mountain, just them and Jesus. We are commanded to go, therefore (Matt 28:19), not, keep the blessing of truth for yourselves! So take off the shame that so hinders your mission, O Christian! </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can recall the exact moment God revealed this truth to me. I was deep in the cycle of sin and self-condemnation! Like Paul I recognized the battle raging within me: In my heart of hearts I so desire to serve God. But I still have this human weakness that so desires to serve its lustful desires. He admits in desperation: &ldquo;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.&rdquo; He goes on, &ldquo;For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do-- this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it&rdquo; (Romans 7:15; 18b-20). </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew Henry comments on the passage, &ldquo;the apostle did not mean that men are not accountable for their sins, but he teaches the evil of their sins, by showing that they are all done against reason and conscience. Sin dwelling in a man does not prove its ruling or having dominion over him. If a man dwells in a city or in a country, still he may not rule there.&rdquo; </span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;It is the eternal battle, good vs evil, only inside every reborn Christian; the old self at war with the new spirit. Sin is still alive and well in us. It is how Adam and Eve could sin so directly against God, how Moses could commit murder, how Peter denied Jesus, and how Ananias and Sapphira could lie to the Holy Spirit. Every one of us is just a step away from committing grievous sins. So we must meet the enemy wherever he is. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world&rdquo; (1 John 4:4)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing shame is accepting defeat. But because of God&rsquo;s sufficient grace (2 Cor 12:9), we can wear his forgiveness and mercy instead. As we learn to offer our shame to God, our trust in him grows, and lasting victory over sin is sure to come. There will always be sin in the believer, but if we trust him, he is faithful to sanctify us more and more into the likeness of his son, Jesus. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gotta act freedom out and apply it before it becomes real. You can be free and not know it! Don&rsquo;t let shame overwhelm you so that you become like 2 Peter 1 and forget that you have been cleansed of your sins, once and for all. Instead, s</span><span>tand on God&rsquo;s promises. </span><span class="c1">Therefore, practice Paul&rsquo;s wisdom from Philippians 3:12: &ldquo;but this one thing I do-- forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c2 c29" id="h.ne3qhzvhmyef"><span class="c15">Chapter Four: Anger</span></h2><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing makes Americans more angry than other Americans.

I don&rsquo;t recall this ever being the case in all of American history. World War 2 is often remembered as a time of unification in the states, a common people with a common enemy. But listen to this veteran: &quot;The army was an experience unlike anything I&#39;ve had in my life. I think of two armies, one black, one white. I saw German prisoners free to move around the camp, unlike black soldiers, who were restricted. The Germans walked right into the doggone places like any white American.

People on different sides of an issue lash out with detestable speech and feel justified to do so. We get so caught up in our personal beliefs, thinking ourselves right, that we lose sight of Jesus&rsquo; message to the world. Life becomes all about lme versus all about living for God and others like Christ. And being angry with God when things don&rsquo;t go according to our plans is a common pitfall as well.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart broke in half when my mother died. It broke into quarters when my mentor moved away. It broke into eighths when my best friend left the church. And it became like dust when all that tension in my heart exploded. I wallowed in distress for all that had happened, and the missing hormones in my brain made it even more difficult to deal with the stress. I spent many sleepless nights, had many angry conversations with God in my car. I remember how I would often sit in my car and shout &ldquo;this sucks&rdquo; over and over, expressing my defeat. I felt like Atlas who bears the weight of the world on his shoulders. But unlike Atlas, instead of holding it up, it crushed me. I collapsed under the 13 billion trillion tons of iron and carbon, much like a bug finds itself suddenly pressed into a single atom upon a car windshield. Letting my problems get the best of me, the force of my anxiety struck me into pieces like the moving car.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through much much much (so much!) prayer and reflection, it became clear that the root of my brokenness was obsession with how things used to be, and anger about how things are now. When mom died, it was like it wasn&rsquo;t real. Intellectually I knew she was gone, but I don&rsquo;t think I ever accepted it. Intellectually I knew my brothers had simply moved on with the next phase of their lives, but in my pride I took it personally and held onto that bitterness. I was never angry with God about my cancer or infection or about nearly dying; being the youngest, I was a momma&rsquo;s boy and admired my brothers like heroes; familial problems hurt me the most.. (These words are particularly difficult to type, I think because I still hold onto that obsession with how things used to be&hellip; Lord, continue to work </span><span>in me</span><span class="c1">.)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways&hellip; anger can be very subtle and is often missed or not identified as an issue at all. When I was in my car I wasn&rsquo;t thinking to myself, &ldquo;Why am I so angry?&rdquo; but &ldquo;this sucks, this sucks.&rdquo; I never stopped to think that the problem could be with how I digested the preceding events and was so quick to cast blame and absorb the pain that comes with as a result of unforgiveness. Anger hides under nearly every negative emotion. It hides beneath past hurt, loss, and regret. It lingers alongside guilt, all sadness, and all insecurity. It was hard for me to identify. Even today, I was driving and thinking about hurt in my past, things that were said to me, uneasiness that I still held onto, and I thought, &ldquo;Why does all this still upset me?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m reminded everyday that the past is far in the past and this keeps me chained. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I move forward?&rdquo; What happened next was groundbreaking. </span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.8owa108poguv"><span class="c16">GOD CONVICTED MY HEART!</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul teaches in Phillipians 3:12, &ldquo;Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me&rdquo; In that moment of confusion in my car, I had to make a resolution: either I dismiss the thought and continue to cast blame and boil in anger or I forgive, cast that burden on Jesus, and &ldquo;press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me&rdquo; (Phil 3:12). The answer is not as obvious as it may seem. In my heart, I did not want to forgive! I wanted to be like that disgruntled employee who quits with a fiery speech. I wanted my enemies to bear the burden of my pain. That is the way of sinful flesh. The way that God commands us to follow is the narrow and difficult path. It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss the command to love others when you&rsquo;re angry. Instead of &ldquo;Lord bless them,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lord, did you see what he did? Did you hear what she said?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to press on is to put the past behind you and look forward to what is in front (Phil 3:14). To press on is to leave everything and follow Jesus, just as he called his disciples. Of Simon and Peter, scripture recalls, &ldquo;At once they left their nets and followed him.&rdquo; (Matt 4:20). Of James and John, it says, &ldquo;immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him&rdquo; (Matt 4:22). And again: &ldquo;As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector&rsquo;s booth. &nbsp;&lsquo;Follow me&rsquo;, he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him&rdquo; (Matt 9:9).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not all would follow so willingly: &nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus told him, &lsquo;If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.&rsquo; When the young man heard this, he went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth&rdquo; (Matt 19:21-22). </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in Luke 9:59-62: &ldquo;Then He said to another, &lsquo;Follow Me.&rsquo; But he said, &lsquo;Lord, let me first go and bury my father.&rsquo; Jesus said to him, &lsquo;Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and preach the kingdom of God.&rsquo; And another also said, &lsquo;Lord, I will follow You, but let me first go and bid them farewell to those who are at my house.&rsquo; But Jesus said to him, &lsquo;No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you holding onto that is more important than following Jesus Christ? For me sitting in my car, it was anger about my past, and I had to give it up. He does not call us to live in anger or regret. He already set us free from the penalty and power of sin, and as an homage to a friend of mine who loves to imitate the stylings of Pastor Derek Prince, if you want to be free, well, be free, you see.&rdquo; Freedom from anger and all burdens comes in denying yourself, your fallen human instincts, and seeking a higher one in the only true God.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, &lsquo;If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel&#39;s will save it&rsquo;&rdquo; (Mark 8:34-35)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we choose to follow Jesus and live by his example, we must first leave everything else behind. That is to say, we need to forget what was so important to us before, and behold him and his purposes at the forefront of our minds. Like many others, my mother was my first love. She was everything to me. Part of God calling me to himself was loosening my attachment and idolization of her and applying it to my relationship with him. But when she passed, I was so angry. I kept holding on, even though she was gone. I was too angry, resentful, frustrated, hurting, and sad. It&rsquo;s strange how these negative emotions give us comfort. I was so used to operating in these boundaries it was uncomfortable and strange to live any way else. I didn&rsquo;t want to let go of my pain because in a way, it felt like letting go of my mother. I was too selfish and unwilling to give to the Lord what was rightfully his from the start.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison to unity with God, nothing else should matter. Nothing should keep us from following him with everything we have. Whatever you&rsquo;re holding onto, beware that it doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of your first duty to abide in God, which is to accept or act in accordance with his ways. The phrase &ldquo;abide in me,&rdquo; Jesus commands his people to remain fervent in seeking him and to dwell richly in a loving relationship with him. Barnes notes </span><span>on the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Bible translates the phrase: &ldquo;Remain united to me by a living faith. Live a life of dependence on me, and obey my doctrines, imitate my example, and constantly exercise faith in me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Jesus and imitating his example is more of a &lsquo;just go and do it&rsquo; more than think hard about how to do it. As Jesus says in his famous Great Commision, &ldquo;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go&hellip;&rdquo; When we trust him and obey by stepping out in faith, he is faithful to do the hard work of changing our own hearts and the hearts of others by speaking and acting through us. All we have to do is say, &nbsp;&quot;yes, Lord&quot; and go. So start today if you haven&#39;t already by putting away fear, &nbsp;shame and anger. </span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.1vdhjbte19mz"><span class="c16">Crossroads</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand it&#39;s a lot harder than it sounds, &nbsp;or as it is just to write the words down as I am doing now. It&#39;s taken 28 years for me to get to this point, and I&rsquo;m just beginning to let go of my deepest desire to control. There is indeed a cost of following Jesus. So often in life one must give before one may receive. Think about exercise, it&rsquo;s difficult and painful, but we do it because we desire the results. Same goes with studying; homework and testing are merely road signs to gauge our progress. Some would say it gets easier as you continue further. A few years ago I went back to school and got my master&rsquo;s degree. It was NOT easier, haha! Although you learn tricks and tips along the way that help you with future tasks, the burden of sucking it up and doing it is always there. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of those tips in following Jesus&#39; example and obeying God rather than man is to look at your life from God&rsquo;s perspective. We see things as past, present, and future. God sees them all at once because he is eternal and not bound by the limitation of time or space. Thinking about things from this point of view takes the edge off big decisions; my destiny is not temporal like this job, it is eternal life in Heaven [if I trust God and repent.] After a point you begin to see everything in this light and by the grace of God your desires and sentiments change. &nbsp;When you cognitively and spirituality give control of your life into God&#39;s hands, things you were once obsessed about and often lament (like me and missing my childhood bond with my brothers) become less and less a burden. Anger you&#39;ve held onto for so long looks less and less attractive. The same goes for all of the words in the circle above; they become deep hidden sins when we choose to idolize and keep them in our hearts. Be free, &nbsp;O Christian! In Christ there is freedom, &nbsp;so be free from all anger. So look again at that image, examine every word, and give it to God.</span></p><p class="c36 c24 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24"><span class="c1">Humble yourselves, therefore, under God&rsquo;s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you (1 Peter 5:6)</span></p><p class="c36 c24 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24"><span class="c1">Cast your burden on the LORD, and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken (Psalm 55:22)</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

Instead, in every situation let your petitions be made known to God through prayers and requests, with thanksgiving. Then God&rsquo;s peace, which goes far beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your hearts and minds in union with the Messiah Jesus</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(Phil 4:6-7)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c16"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the picturesque moment of a father and child walking together holding hands. It is a picture of the father&rsquo;s protection and care and, when we hold onto his hand, of the child&rsquo;s trust and confidence! Will you stand before him bereft of any emotional walls? Will you take hold of his hand as he takes hold of yours? Let go of your anger and all its disguises! Say, &ldquo;Yes, Lord,&rdquo; and commit to follow him, and he will do the rest.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me&rdquo; (Luke 9:23)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What God values and what the world values are diametrically opposed to one another. To be holy is to be set apart from the things the world desires. Like I said, there is a cost to following Christ. To take up one&rsquo;s cross is to carry your death, to be willing to suffer and die for the sake of holding Christ as your Savior. The world would say that this is too great a cost. At the cross of Christ we come to a turning point, the climax of the story! It is the ultimate crossroad: two choices leading to two eternal destinies. It becomes a blessing for those who would submit and obey or a curse for those who would not (Deut 11:26-28). Heaven is not just escaping punishment, it&rsquo;s enjoying God&rsquo;s perfection forever, and is the reward for following Jesus. Neither is Hell just a one time death and it&#39;s over. It&rsquo;s eternal suffering, dying forever, and is the reward for disobedience.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denying yourself is an act of obedience whilst nurturing your sinful tendencies is not. If you want to follow Jesus, you must deny your natural inclination to sin. Deny your natural inclination to be angry and to hold onto hate. Deny the power of anger to magnify past hurt, past pain, past guilt. To deny yourself is to press on! Let the past be in the past, and </span><span>choose new</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;life. I love Paul&rsquo;s conviction when he writes in Hebrews 3:13, &ldquo;But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called &lsquo;Today,&rsquo; so that none of you may be hardened by sin&rsquo;s deceitfulness.&rdquo; As long as it is called &lsquo;Today,&rdquo; live out the example of Jesus. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c2 c29" id="h.568di2i7gyy0"><span class="c15">Chapter Five: Pride</span></h2><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends, don&rsquo;t miss this: Pride is the reason Satan was cast out of heaven. </span></p><p class="c6"><span><br>&ldquo;How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low!

Pride </span><span>says me</span><span>&nbsp;first! My way! I make the rules! It takes the seat only God deserves and makes the individual his or her own god. C.S. Lewis called it &ldquo;the complete anti-God state of mind:&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The essential vice, the utmost evil, is pride. &nbsp;Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through pride that the devil became the devil. &nbsp;Pride leads to every other vice.&rdquo; (C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason, I hate being taken advantage of (this is my pride). Last year I was working at Target as a cashier and saw the same situation all too often. Customers would come to my lane with a fancy speech and try to convince me to give them a discount. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no price tag so that must mean it&rsquo;s free!&rdquo; I came to hate that joke, if they were really joking. Customers would straight up lie and try to manipulate me. One transaction in particular stands in my mind. A couple came in chatting and making polite conversation. It was all a ploy to distract me. (I can&rsquo;t even write about it. It makes me so angry! Lord help me deal with this anger.) In short, they stole a bunch of stuff and it made me feel awful. And no one, when confronted with the truth, had the humility to say, &ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t see that anywhere in the world, especially in this day and age. Life is all about &lsquo;me&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine.&rsquo; God calls us otherwise as new creations. The old creation behaves that way, never the new.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God calls us to live </span><span>selflessly, not for ourselves but for God and others</span><span>; self</span><span>i</span><span class="c1">shness is the damaging effect of pride.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we consciously choose to sin instead of swallowing our pride and obey God&rsquo;s commands, we are choosing to separate ourselves from God. And to separate one&rsquo;s self from God is to willingly choose one&rsquo;s own death. All sin, even the littlest white lie, condemns us guilty. Do not take lightly the consequence of your iniquity, for, &ldquo;the wages of sin is death&rdquo; (Rom 6:23). Death is what we earn by selfish sinful living.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride is a veil before the truth. It tells us we are doing fine, that we are good people. It makes excuses on our behalf and seeks to defend our self-image. Ever heard or thought something like this? </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c43 lst-kix_t82pfa1la580-0 start"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c31 c25">&ldquo;Sure nobody is perfect, but we&rsquo;re not criminals or anything.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c31 c25">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told lies before, but I&rsquo;m not a liar.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c31 c25">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as bad as those people are, they are sinners, not me.&rdquo;</span></li></ul><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are naturally inclined to protect themselves from danger. When a threat appears, we react to neutralize said threat or escape from it. This is the famous fight or flight response. Can you see it in the examples above? See how the individual dodges the question and turns it around? Rather than owning up to the truth, we&rsquo;d rather lie about it and throw someone else under the bus. Adam and Eve did the same thing after they were caught disobeying God! Adam blamed and Eve, Eve blamed the snake; according to them, it was anyone else&rsquo;s fault but theirs. Pride warps reality to favor an appearance of righteousness. But it&rsquo;s only an appearance.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Spurgeon adds, &ldquo;Pride is so natural to fallen man that it springs up in his heart like weeds in a well-watered garden. Its every touch is evil. You may hunt down this fox, and think you have destroyed it, and lo! Your very exultation is pride. None have more pride than those who dream that they have none. Pride is a sin with a thousand lives; it seems impossible to kill it.&rdquo; It prefers lies instead of the truth that exposes our sin. There are many false teachings moving around the world, many lies that would seek to distract us from the truth, and people eat them up because they are easy and comfortable. Lies like, people are born into a right relationship with God, that God is love and won&rsquo;t judge me because of my disobedience. If I live a good life, I will be rewarded. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw this in a recent Oscar winner who referenced her Chinese heritage in the acceptance speech. She remembered a poem from her childhood that goes, &ldquo;When a child is born, at its root it is good. Everyone&rsquo;s nature is the same but everyone experiences different things. If there is no Way, we will move away from our nature. The teaching of the Way is valuable because it is particular to each man.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s referring to Taoism or Daoism which doesn&rsquo;t follow a god, but what is called the dao: &ldquo;Something unformed and complete before heaven and earth were born&hellip; </span><span>it is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;like the mother of all things under heaven. I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s name, better call it Dao, or great&rdquo; (Tao te Ching, Ch 25). It is a similar claim to humanism and naturalism and many other world philosophies which see the created as omnipotent, not the creator.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem began when we discounted the existence and authority of God. People get upset and offended at the claims of God because they deny personal freedom to live however one wants. It is offensive because it denies false gods and false lifestyles. I was driving and saw on the car in front of my a &ldquo;Coexist&rdquo; sticker with symbols from many religions. The precept of peace is good, but the thing about objective truth is that they cannot coexist. Jesus teaches that, no, you can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too. He teaches that there is only one way to eternal redemption. Many will disagree and become angry. The Bible is offensive and people don&rsquo;t like it because it strikes against our pride. The way is narrow and people want it to be wide.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.f44q7vxctfe1"><span class="c7">Walking</span></h3><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c7">&ldquo;Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart&rdquo; (Ps 51:5-6)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth in the inward being! Expose the lies in your heart, tear down the walls of pride and stand naked before the Lord! Stop hiding behind false personas! Stop covering your blemishes with excuses! You&rsquo;d do better for yourself to be honest. You don&rsquo;t need to cover your weaknesses anymore. Be honest with yourself and find someone you can be accountable to. The first step to putting away pride is allowing yourself to be vulnerable.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c36 c24"><span class="c1 c7">&ldquo;Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much&rdquo; (Jas 5:16)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we have the church, to sharpen one another, to walk side by side, to pursue righteousness and honor God together. The world-wide church is a singular unit. It is composed of individuals who each have a lot of problems and weaknesses. But as a whole, the church is effectively preparing the way for Christ&rsquo;s return by refining every Christian into his likeness and fighting against evil. Paul enlists the church at Ephesus, saying, &ldquo;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil&rsquo;s schemes&rdquo; (Eph 6:10-11). The letter wasn&rsquo;t written to one Christian but to the whole church. Through the whole of the Bible, it is a command for every Christian. Each Christian is therefore a soldier; the whole church is God&rsquo;s holy army.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a church body we must get rid of pride and trust wholly in God. Encourage your brothers and sisters to mimic the posture of King David in the Psalms. Psalm 51 is a song of great joy and great lament. David is torn by guilt and bears heavily the weight of his shame. In verses 1-4, he exclaimed with great grief, &ldquo;Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight; so you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David knew with great certainty the quality of his heart. He, like all of us, was riddled with the disease of sin and it caused him unparalleled distress. Wanting to please God and honor him as Lord, David served with all of his days. But nothing he could do, no service was powerful enough to erase his many mistakes or excuse his guilt before God. His humility reflects that. Even then, his sin was ever before him and he could not get rid of that which he hated most. He put off his pride before God, and laid it all out. Surely he was afraid to be honest, to tell the great judge the truth about his crimes. But he did it anyway, because he trusted God with every inch of himself. David had a clear understanding of who he was as a sinner in need of forgiveness, and who God is, as the only means of escaping damnation, and as an added gift, to be restored into unity with God himself!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may, however, convince ourselves that we are righteous without God and inherently good, looking at the very best of our thoughts and deeds. &ldquo;Surely I&rsquo;m not a sinner deserving of eternal hellfire!&rdquo; And even be so bold as to blame God instead of acknowledging our sin: &ldquo;What kind of God would send people to Hell, anyway?&rdquo; This is why God gave us the Law, the Ten Commandments, to show us that we are not good, but evil. It clearly reveals how we are not sufficient in our own right but desperately need to be covered by his righteousness. It takes away proud confidence in our own abilities.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the world judged itself only by the first of the ten commandments, everyone would fall on their face and weep. Not only is it the basis for the rest of the nine, but its focus is on pride, the very essence of human weakness. Jesus describes it in more depth later in Matthew, but the original commandment reads, &ldquo;You shall have no other gods before me&rdquo; (Ex 20:3). Jesus&rsquo; rendition is different, but maintains the same focus: &ldquo;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment&rdquo; (Matt 22:37-28).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem odd to a modern world that is largely secular. However &ldquo;gods&rdquo; come in other forms than religious deities. The word for &ldquo;gods&rdquo; used in the original command is &ldquo;elohim,&rdquo; a plural word also used as the name for the triune God of the Bible. It is a word signifying deity-- is there anything that you deify other than God? The Bible calls this worshiping idols. For some it is the gods of other religions, but for most of us, it&#39;s things like money, possessions, professions, hobbies, etc. &nbsp;Do not give the seat of honor in your life to anything else than God alone. Pride is the greatest barrier to the first commandment, and thereby the other nine, &nbsp;because it places love of self above God.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c16 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride is finding sufficiency in yourself, in your own abilities and achievements. Get rid of that thinking! Pride is me first, God and others second. Get rid of that, it&rsquo;s a lie! Pride says I can earn my way into God&rsquo;s favor. Perish the thought, it&rsquo;s false! The Bible is clear as day: trust in Christ alone; Jesus plus anything else is blasphemy. Our good works cannot save us, only Christ!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.

James declares, &ldquo;So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.&rdquo; He is not saying faith plus works is the only way to salvation. He is differentiating faith that is dead and faith that is alive. The believer who puts away his pride and works for the kingdom and his righteousness accomplishes much through the Spirit and for God (Jas 5:16; Matt 17:20). The believer who pridefully remains obstinate in sin destroys their faith and cannot please God (Rom 8:7-8; Heb 11:6). Jesus lays it all out with a short parable in Luke 18:9-14:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><p class="c36 c24"><span class="c1 c7">&ldquo;He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: &ldquo;Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: &lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.&rsquo; But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, &lsquo;God, be merciful to me, a sinner!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you like the Pharisee, proud and arrogant? If you&rsquo;re human like me, chances are good that you are. There are few of us who do not hold onto pride. We are naturally excited by our achievements and feel honored when people point them out. We look at the time we spend in prayer, reading, and sharing the gospel as points toward a prize rather than as an act of worship. If that is you, join me by falling to your knees like the tax collector and embrace God&rsquo;s forgiveness and fatherly love. Repentance is not a one time instance. It is daily, hourly, minute by minute, second by second, admitting my weakness and acknowledging his strength. Saving faith responds to God&rsquo;s calling. Faith that is dead does not.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.50ub20hmwzhk"><span class="c16">Pride Clings to Comfort - Abdicates Responsibility</span></h3><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would you have God say to you when you stand before him?

This is what those people in Matt 7:22 thought. They answered the teacher&rsquo;s question by counting all their achievements and points of high renown: &ldquo;have we. not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast. out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?&rdquo; How audacious to say to God, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m deserving.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax collector from Luke 18:14 approaches the throne differently. He admits his frailty before the almighty God and begs for mercy. His response affirms his own weakness and wickedness as well as God&rsquo;s ability to save him. It&rsquo;s the good news of Jesus (John 3:16), trusting in God alone (Rom. 4:5), through grace alone (Eph. 2:8-9), acknowledging our dire need for mercy (Titus 3:5). Notice the total absence of pride. Our response to why God should let us in is not, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m deserving,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;I am not deserving. But my life is hidden in Jesus, the only one who is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of his saving grace and mercy and wonderful blessings, Christians must adopt a new way of thinking and living that is all about Jesus! Paul encourages his congregation to live as those made alive in Christ:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Since then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God&rdquo; (Col 3:3)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing! Because of his faithfulness and grace, we are now hidden and covered by Christ&rsquo;s righteousness and grafted into God&rsquo;s holy family! So going back to that student teacher example, when we stand before the Great Judge, he&rsquo;ll pop his head over his desk and ask, &ldquo;Why should I let you into the kingdom of Heaven?&rdquo; But because I&rsquo;m now hidden in Christ and covered by his holiness, no longer my own weaknesses and sin, Jesus will say, oh him? He&rsquo;s forgiven, it&rsquo;s ok Father, and Jesus will usher you in.</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c22 c20 c25 c88">Wow!

At one time, these nations were enemies at war. The United States was once the same, seperate people with separate goals. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for parallel nations to merge and make peace, though the means are not always pleasant. Before 1801, the island of Great Britain included the English Kingdom, which included Wales, and the Scotish Kingdom. These two kingdoms have a long history of conflict and even though they are united, a subtle resentment still lingers to this day. Contemplating the question, &ldquo;Do Scots really hate the English?&rdquo; Adam Ramsey said, &ldquo;It is perhaps best summarised with the fact that the ultimate insult at my school - &#39;Scoit&#39; - was reserved for those who had a hint of a Scots accent, until it was bullied out of them. And this isn&#39;t just school children. Recently, I was told by an adult of this background that Scots are lazy. When referring to Scottish people, it is common for the class in which I grew up to talk about &lsquo;them&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;us&rsquo;. &lsquo;They are Scottish. We are British.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discrimination is a dangerous kind of strife that arises when a majority is threatened by someone different than them. It teaches people to see a group of people as divided, as enemies, and encourages acts of violence. It is instinctive for people to gravitate toward groups sharing commonalities like sex, race, and status. Likemindedness creates a comfortable environment. That seems to explain why tension arises when groups that differ come into close contact. Likemindedness is broken if just one falls outside the circle. Like Adam said, now there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;them.&rdquo; It is human nature to be selfish and close-minded: &ldquo;You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?&rdquo; (1 Cor 3:3).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the same trend in the Bible. Before Abraham got his new name he was called Abram. And Abram has a cousin, Lot. They each had a family to take care of, and it came to a point where their families grew too large and the land couldn&rsquo;t sustain them both. One day, fighting started amongst Abram&rsquo;s herders and Lot&rsquo;s, presumably over grazing fields for their flocks. A split was inevitable, but it was not always so. Before Abram&rsquo;s became wealthy, there was no mention of strife: &ldquo;Poverty and labour, wants and wanderings, could not separate Abram and Lot; but riches did so.&rdquo; </span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;As Abram&rsquo;s tribe grew, there divided an &ldquo;us&rdquo; and a &ldquo;them.&rdquo; When goods were shared by both, now it was &ldquo;mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;yours.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus notices this trend in the gospels. In Jewish culture, the poor, the sick and disabled were reviled and thought to be in such a state because of personal sin. They were discriminated against, hated even, and seen as &lsquo;unclean.&rsquo; If a Jew came into close contact with someone like this, they would have to go through an arduous ritual to be cleansed and went to great lengths to distance themselves. Humans in our hubris see only the outward differences and hate those who are different. Jesus, on the other hand, looks at the heart. In the &ldquo;clean&rdquo; he saw riddled with disease, but the poor and unclean he counted as blessed because of their humility. &ldquo;Out of the heart, you see, come evil plots, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, and blasphemy. These are the things that make someone unclean&rdquo; (Matt 15: 19-20).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tells a parable to explain the matter further, of a rich man and a poor man named Lazarus. Lazarus sat at the rich man&rsquo;s gate everyday entrenched in poverty. The rich man must have passed by him everyday, but did nothing to help. Jesus notes that &ldquo;he was covered in sores and longed to eat what fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table&rdquo; (Luke 16:20-21). When they died, Lazarus went to Heaven and the rich man went to Hell. Suffering greatly, the rich man cries out for help but hears the reply, &ldquo;Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony&rdquo; (Luke 16:25-26). The rich man&rsquo;s wealth distracted him from what really matters. He was too focused on living well than serving God, on acquiring earthly treasures instead of heavenly ones. The enmity he held against Lazarus did nothing for his eternal soul except doom it for eternity.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.qq85lhu66fwz"><span class="c16">Always a Boxing Match</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve lost the art of critical conversation. Everyone has a side, an &ldquo;us&rdquo; and a &ldquo;them.&rdquo; Democrats vs Republicans, Dodger fans vs Yankee fans, Christians vs Muslims, liberal lifestyles vs conservative. You can&rsquo;t talk about serious issues anymore without someone getting offended and lashing out. One day in class we had food for the students and a war broke out over whether or not pineapple was good on pizza. It doesn&rsquo;t seem weird to me but to them, it was like a big cockroach crawling all over their slice. Passion bubbles close to the surface. What we like is being confused with who we are, and somehow, if you don&rsquo;t like what the person likes, you don&rsquo;t like them.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;What&#39;s more is that we distance ourselves from one another because they&#39;re &quot;strangers.&quot; I was walking down the street and there was another guy walking towards me. We turned down the same street but I went to one side and he went to the other. &nbsp;It was like a magnet separated us. &nbsp;For whatever reason, &nbsp;it feels awkward being near someone you don&#39;t know. I thought about this as I was walking and became afraid at the idea of casually starting up a conversation. &nbsp;So much so that i decided not to. There was no visible conflict between me and him, but there was still an &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot; </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What starts as a simple disagreement or unfamiliarity can quickly turn into a bloody conflict. We unfortunately see this all the time in America. It is notorious for social unrest. The same palpable tension existed between the Jews and the Gentiles (non- Jewish persons). The Jews&#39; hatred for them went back centuries. The Gentiles worshiped other gods and had practices that were abominable to God and the Jews. So when Jesus came on the scene and preached forgiveness and reconciliation, &nbsp;to the Jews first and then also to the Gentiles, &nbsp;the religious elites who stood to gain from conflict showed their true colors. Turns out they didn&#39;t love God or the people. </span></p><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 310.87px; height: 263.26px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 310.87px; height: 263.26px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Pharisees lived morally perfect lives and were renowned for their high religiosity and adherence to all the laws of the Old Testament. Because of their piety, they thought themselves righteous, &nbsp;better than everyone else. &nbsp;Jesus came along speaking a new message, one that undermined all their good works. He called them sinners, even! This was slander to the Pharisees and deeply offensive. Imagine the worst name you could call someone and multiply it by ten. The religious leaders of Jesus&rsquo; time hated him because he preached a different message. They were jealous of how the people loved him and hated Jesus because they feared the change he would bring. They didn&#39;t want to lose their position of power and wealth. And what did this hatred lead to? They crucified the man, sentenced him to a most horrible death, simply to protect their pride.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Problems and disagreements are a natural part of life. But their existence shouldn&#39;t lead to strife. &nbsp;There is always the opportunity amidst tension to prevent division. But it must be taken, &nbsp;because as the chain reaction continues, &nbsp;it becomes harder and harder to stop. Strife is like a tornado, if you can&rsquo;t stop the problem at its source, it becomes something vile. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam;. so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out&rdquo; (Prov 17:14)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aren&rsquo;t we just like the Pharisees? Our ideals and desires get the best of us and bring us to do terrible things. At times we hate Jesus ourselves because of what he says. We like to fight God on matters that go against our passions. God says no, but&hellip; God said do this, but&hellip; We fight with God over possession and don&rsquo;t want to surrender ourselves to Him. This is never a good idea and the outcome will always be defeat. If you think you can have strife with God and live, you got another thing coming. It is possible, and a good idea even, to box with God if you have the right intentions. Jacob fought with God in the Old Testament and it was counted to him as a blessing. But if you&rsquo;re sore at God because of his words, then please be careful!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The context to Jacob&rsquo;s story is that he&rsquo;s about to see his brother Esau again. This will be their first meeting since he tricked him out of his birthright and ran away. Esau was steaming mad. After finding out about Jacob&#39;s trick, he exclaims, &ldquo;The days of sorrow over my father&rsquo;s death are near. Then I&rsquo;ll kill my brother Jacob&rdquo; (Gen 27:41). In the Hebrew language, &ldquo;Jacob&rdquo; sounds like the word for &ldquo;heel,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;grabbing someone&rsquo;s heel,&rdquo; the hebrew saying for trickery. Interestingly, Jacob actually came out of his mother&rsquo;s womb holding onto Esau&rsquo;s heel. The great Jacob who later became the father of all Israel, was a trickster, thief and a liar. You can imagine how upset and disappointed Esau must have felt.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Esau is coming for a visit and Jacob is nervous. He is worrying if Esau remembers his deception and if he is still angry. Esau also has a bunch of people with him. Are they just his friends, or is Esau bringing an army against me? One night, in the midst of his fright, a man appears out of nowhere and starts to wrestle with Jacob. The fight dragged out for hours and wore both contenders out. It wasn&rsquo;t like a little tiff amongst friends, but an all-out brawl. The man sees that Jacob will not give in, so he </span><span>dislocated</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;his hip with a gentle touch. But Jacob still doesn&rsquo;t give in. The fight continues past sunrise and the man tells Jacob to let him go. But Jacob knew there was something special about the man and responded, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you go unless you bless me&rdquo; (Gen 32:26). Jacob fought against pain and exhaustion to hold onto God and wait for a promise. This story teaches us to trust God and hold out despite the cost, to never blame God for the pain but to endure to the end and expect to see his many blessings.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob proves his faithfulness and God blesses him. He gives Jacob a new name, Israel, meaning God contends, or one who struggles with God. The difference between Jacob&rsquo;s conflict with God is that strife was completely absent. There was no bitterness in his heart against God for injuring him, nor for the prolonged struggle. The Bible teaches of many other people that wrestled with God.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon Peter struggled against doubts after Jesus was captured by the guards and taken to the cross. He was overwhelmed with fear and denied Jesus three times. He didn&rsquo;t trust God and instead focused on the weight of his present circumstances. Jesus visited him after ascending into Heaven and convicted his heart. Peter responds in faith and becomes the rock on which the early church was founded, saying, &nbsp;&quot;Yes, Lord.&quot; Elijah contended with his faith while being persecuted by the king&rsquo;s wife Jezebel. He was afraid, so much so that he ran away and asked God to end his life. God would raise him up again to be bold and Elijah says, &nbsp;&quot;Yes, Lord.&quot; Moses was too afraid to follow Gods command to confront the Pharaoh but at the end of the day, he trust God and says, &nbsp;&quot;Yes, Lord!&quot; Our human nature fears every little thing, &nbsp;but will you hold onto God as Jacob did and say, &nbsp;&quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; despite how you feel and despite your challenges? Wrestling with God produces faithfulness. We can&#39;t give ourselves fully to God without the presence of hardship, nor can we fix our gaze on Jesus if there are no other things to look at. So when we fight God, wrestling and struggling to hold on in faith, let it not be in disobedience but with long-suffering and patience, waiting and expecting Him to move mightily in and through our lives.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 243.69px; height: 254.97px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 243.69px; height: 254.97px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus had every opportunity and right to fight back against the Pharisees and the Roman Guard as they condemned him to death. He reveals this to his companions when they defended him from arrest: &ldquo;Put your sword back in its place. For all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Are you not aware that I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?&ldquo; (Matt 26:53). Jesus never looked to himself or others for strength. His eyes were firmly centered on God the Father and on his plans. In his humanness, Jesus experienced unthinkable pain and humiliation on the cross. And in his humanness he cried out for deliverance: &ldquo;My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?&rdquo; (Mark 15:34). In bearing the eternal weight of our sin, the human Jesus felt separated from the Father; the depths of our iniquity and shame overwhelmed his flesh. He did this to fulfill the Scriptures and carry out the Father&rsquo;s will. Despite his pain and suffering, Jesus said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord,&rdquo; and trusted the Father.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.murqbcxm2ion"><span class="c16">Christ Cooperated</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christian life is one of trusting and acting. We look to the promises of God and the foundation of the Bible for guidance and then we stand on them and, day by day, we live them out. But life is hard and full of strife. I love Jesus&rsquo; words of comfort to the disciples before he&rsquo;s arrested. He says, &ldquo;I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world&ldquo; (John 16:33). Jesus overcame the world by his love. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strife is living for oneself and sees every infraction on one&rsquo;s prosperity as a reason to box. Love is living for God and sees these infractions as an opportunity for God to work out his plan. Jesus did not contend against the world but cooperated with the Father and with the disciples for a purpose greater than himself. We have a greater purpose ourselves - the calling to transform the world by our Christ-likeness. Great philosophers and humanitarians achieve noble things for the world at large. But Christians can feed the world in a way that lasts by spreading the eternal truth of Jesus through selfless love. Paul teaches us to be like Christ by dying to ourselves in service to God and people, affirming Jesus&#39; words in John 15:13: &ldquo;There is no greater love than to lay down one&rsquo;s life for one&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo; So we cooperate with God in his mission of love for the sake of Jesus and eternal life for everyone around us.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins&rdquo; (1 John 4:10)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus loved people when they were utterly unlovable. He teaches in the book of Matthew not to simply love those who love us in return but to love even our enemies (5:43-44)! This is counterintuitive to the worldly person because no body thinks like that. The Christian, however, is called to something higher than him or herself. I&rsquo;ll always go back to this passage to remember my purpose in this life: </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments&rdquo; (Matt 22:37-40)</span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c28"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pharisees tried to stump Jesus by asking him what the most important law was. He had just finished schooling them on another question they had. The Pharisees thought they knew everything and were attempting to trap Jesus and prove to the people that he was a liar. But Jesus doesn&#39;t lie. He has the same greater purpose in everything he says. In his response, Jesus actually traps them. They might&rsquo;ve thought their love for God was deep enough already, but things get dicey when you look at how well you&rsquo;ve loved other people. The type of love Jesus commands them to show is the same kind that we show to ourselves: &nbsp;to feed, tend to, dote upon, and have compassion and understanding for. We show our love for God in the same way, by giving back everything we have and everything we are. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c28"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are experiencing strife in your heart, with another person, or with God, simply return to God.

Lust is the beginning of sin</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in amazing times of great invention and progress. It&rsquo;s come to a point where the science of convenience is so advanced that you can have anything you could possibly want at the click of a button. Any appetite you have can be quickly sated with any number of apps and services and you don&rsquo;t have to talk to anyone to do it. If I&rsquo;m feeling lazy I can order food delivery from a restaurant a few blocks down. If I&rsquo;m &nbsp;busy I can arrange a pick up service to get my groceries. Or if I&rsquo;m feeling sexual desire, I can find millions of websites that suggest millions of different avenues. There&rsquo;s no limit to getting what we want when we want it.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about what happens when you give a child everything he or she wants. The same thing is happening to grown adults today. Ever wonder how &ldquo;Karens&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kens&rdquo; are made? If you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, a Karen or Ken is a person who causes a nasty fuss over trivial issues like long lines at the store or not getting mustard when you asked for mustard. Even though internet culture has come to loathe these people, chances are good that you are one as well, just maybe not as volatile.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the cause of this irritability is a misalignment of desire and expectation. Because of these services, the &ldquo;thirty minutes or it&rsquo;s free&rdquo; standard has become our normal expectation. That, if I have to wait too long or if I don&rsquo;t get exactly what I want, then somehow I&rsquo;m entitled to lash out like a cranky child. Hopefully our impatience never gets that bad, but that&rsquo;s the popular example in most Karen sightings.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why am I talking about this in a chapter about lust? It turns out the Bible classifies lust in a couple different ways. 1 John 2:16 says, &ldquo;For everything in the world&mdash;the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life&mdash;comes not from the Father but from the world.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life-- three different ways we can understand lust. These three show themselves vividly in the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.<br></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, while they were enjoying life and communing with God, the serpent comes along to break their perfect lives apart. The serpent is smart and knows exactly how to deceive the humans. He appeals to their senses! It knew that they had hunger and thirst and desires and played that to his advantage. After convincing Eve that filling her body&rsquo;s desire was not a bad thing, she looks at the tree that God told them not to eat from. Keep in mind that Adam was right there with her. God gave him responsibility to look after everything that was made, and because he neglected to protect Eve in this moment, the Bible sees him as chiefly responsible (Rom 5:12; 1 Cor 15:22). Anyways, Eve&rsquo;s lust appears in Genesis 3:6: &nbsp;&ldquo;When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.&rdquo; She allows her desire to overwhelm her thoughts. In that moment, she forgets all about God&rsquo;s stern command and she entertains her lust. She sins.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first lust she experiences is her body&rsquo;s desire for the fruit. She sees the fruit and boy does it look good. It would be like those Carl&rsquo;s Jr. commercials with those massive cheeseburgers and you see the meat is all steamy and sauce is dripping everywhere. Makes me hungry every time! She thinks about how good it would taste, she thinks about how satisfying the texture is. She lets her imagination run wild! Now her stomach&rsquo;s rumbling and she&rsquo;s getting desperate...</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next she feels the lust of the eyes. She notices the fruit again, except this time she focuses on how it shines in the sunlight. She sees it as something valuable, something worth possessing. Like the Cadillac in that car dealership window. She looks and looks, dreaming of what it would be like to have it. She feels her skin tingling with anxiety and her stomach wells up with impatience. She remembers how hungry she is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third lust she falls into is the pride of life. The serpent had told Eve that taking the fruit would make her wise like God, knowing good and evil (Gen 3:5). After listening to her growing hunger and desires it with her eyes, she&rsquo;s lost her foundation in God. Suddenly she realizes that, not only will the fruit satisfy my flesh, not only is it something beautiful like jewelry, but it can give me power, the thing people crave above everything else! Control! Dominion! Autonomy! When she finally takes the apple, she succumbs to her lust, and Adam follows soon after. It is such a subtle feeling, but has potential to be so damaging. Look at what happened right after! God threw them out into the world of sin and death! </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lust is the reason why we disobey God. We want things God says are not good and we go around his instruction to get them. It is also the reason why evil is so widespread and commonplace. When people want things they can&rsquo;t afford or don&rsquo;t have the means to acquire, sometimes they are willing to go down all sorts of sinful roads to get them.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan used the same strategy on Jesus when he was being tempted in the wilderness (Matt 4:1-11). He tempted Jesus with the lust of his flesh by dangling the thought of bread in front of him. After forty days, Jesus was quite literally starving. That bread must have sounded so delicious and satisfying, better than the Carl&rsquo;s Jr. burger even. But Jesus remembers what the Bible says and he uses it like a sword. Instead of obeying his desires, Jesus obeys the Word of God.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Satan tempts him with the pride of life. He challenges Jesus with a dare. I don&rsquo;t know what it is about foolish dares but they&rsquo;re always so tempting. Maybe it&rsquo;s because we feel the need to prove ourselves for some reason. Regardless, Jesus doesn&rsquo;t budge. Satan dares him to jump off a tall building and rely on his angels to rescue him. but Jesus knows better. Again, Jesus quotes scripture like a weapon. He doesn&rsquo;t bite.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan tempts him for a third time with the lust of his eyes. He shows him &ldquo;all the kingdoms of the world with their splendor&rdquo; (vss 8-9). The buildings are shining and the land is breathtakingly gorgeous and Satan says you can have it if you bow to me. But Jesus doesn&rsquo;t give in. He resists Satan by reciting the truth in God&rsquo;s Word again.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s keep these two examples in the back of our minds as we continue forward, the first of sin and failure, the second of righteousness and victory.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.stu52y88pago"><span class="c16">Lust Bringeth Forth</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c75 c76">2. Lust is ignoring God and doing things our own way</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a young Christian, I had a real problem with controlling my desires. They took advantage of me too often and encouraged me to do things that dishonored God. Lust brought forth in me great division, fear, and separation from the richness of his presence, just as it did with Adam. I was and still am responsible for the decisions I made to follow my lusts instead of God and the consequences which came with it. But why does this happen? How could the loving words of God become so clouded and distorted that people would forsake him for a momentary rush of pleasure? If Adam is responsible for sin entering into the world (Romans 5:12), what made him fail? What caused Eve to disregard God&rsquo;s instruction? What was it exactly that clouds their/our judgement?</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam&rsquo;s true sin was disregarding God&rsquo;s holiness. He didn&rsquo;t take God seriously and instead of obeying God, chose to abdicate his responsibility to watch over Eve and protect the Garden: &ldquo;And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it&rdquo; (Gen 2:15). Adam named all the animals and had intimate knowledge of what was in the garden and how to care for it. He knew about God&rsquo;s command not to eat from the trees and he likely had knowledge about the serpent as well. If he named the serpent, we can derive that he knew what it was like: &ldquo;Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made&rdquo; (Gen 3:1). So why did he not warn Even?</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same question could be asked of us. If we know the dangers of things God says are not good, why do we permit them in our lives? Why do we not protect ourselves and those around us from sinful influences in music and movies, on TV, on the radio, and so on? Why do we allow our children to dress promiscuously and say indecent things? It must be because in some way, we value the instruction of the world. We were deceived by the serpent ourselves! We chose, like Adam and Eve, to obey it and the temptation of our lust instead of God. Desire is not an inherently sinful thing. But when it takes precedence above God, or when it requires us to bend God&rsquo;s Word into a new shape, it becomes something exceedingly wicked. Never neglect God&rsquo;s teaching; it is for our short and long term benefit to listen and obey, as one takes the advice of a wise man.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lust is just like the serpent -- crafty, subtle and misleading. As the serpent lies to us, so do our desires. We use words like &ldquo;need&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;want.&rdquo; As in, &ldquo;I need one of these.&rdquo; During the COVID pandemic, we labeled businesses like Target and Walmart as &ldquo;essential&rdquo; when the majority of our time spent there is for superfluous shopping. You see something you want and get that twinkle in your eye. It grows until your judgement is completely overwhelmed. It continues to grow and the desire fills your whole body. And guess what, before you know it you&rsquo;ve lost sight of everything else. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c75">3.

And sin &lsquo;brings forth death&rsquo; because it severes our unity with God and leads to Hell when untamed. So to stop sin and evil in the world, all we need to do is keep our lusts in check. Not as easy as it seems. But God does help us and gives us many tools for holy living. The same tools that Adam and Eve had access to, but chose to neglect. They endured many consequences for their choice to be their own god and make their own decisions. The solution to our lust and all of our sin is to make the right choice, the choice that leads to life.<br></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon before the Israelites claimed the promised land, after wandering in the desert for forty years, God renewed his covenant agreement with the people. He says, &ldquo;See, I have set before you today life and goodness, as well as death and disaster&hellip; Therefore choose life, so that you and your descendants may live&hellip; For He is your life, and He will prolong your life in the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&rdquo; (Deut 30:16; 19-20). God shows the Israelites their blessed future. He disciplined them in the desert because of their unfaithfulness and is giving them another chance. The stakes are high. He doesn&rsquo;t promise them prosperity without cost. In order to be God&rsquo;s people, the Israelites were commanded to deny the lusts of their flesh, the lust of their eyes, and the lusts of arrogance, the pride of life.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.2yzx5kxibgmg"><span class="c16">Choose Life Not Lust</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c75 c76">4. By the power of Jesus we can choose life instead of lust</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again&rdquo; (John 3:3)</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus said this to the pharisee Nicodemus to pierce through his religiosity. Nic was a religious leader, a trained holy man who appeared outwardly perfect in front of the masses. People looked to him for guidance and in that culture, the power that came with his position was quite tempting. Many Pharisees and religious leaders abused this and took glory for themselves. Jesus tells Nicodemus plainly that his religious works could not give him salvation. He tells him instead that the only way is to be born again. John and Peter echo his words in their own writings:</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God&rdquo; (1 John 3:9)<br><br>&ldquo;Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently with a pure heart, having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever&rdquo; (1 Peter 1:23) </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicodemus is confused, and rightly so. He asks, how can a person be born again, how can a man be born when he is old? (John 3:4). Christians, because of the regenerate Spirit of God living in us, because our shackles were broken by the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross for our iniquity, we can be born again even in old age. Through Christ, God offers us a choice-- to remain as we are, spiritually dead in sin, thinking one&rsquo;s self happy because of their lusts though in spiritual depravity, or, to offer yourself as a living sacrifice and live for Christ and Christ alone and thereby receive unity with God now and forever.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Jesus, we are no longer slaves to the passion of lust. Shall I take this freedom for myself and squander it, continuing to live in sin and forsaking his sacrifice? By no means, Paul would say! Because of Jesus, the Christian wants to do everything he can to give back a measure of blessing. We do not make a practice of sinning because we desire to honor God. As the Christian continues to follow, the Son of God abides in them and protects them and teaches them to deny the passions of lust. 1 Peter declares, &ldquo;You have been born anew, not of perishable seed but of imperishable , through the living and abiding word of God&rdquo; (1:23). Because we are born anew, we &nbsp;may choose the life of service and so gain Christ.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we follow Jesus and live by faith, we enter into a new way of being, a new way of relating to people and the world. Paul identifies this effect as &ldquo;the newness of life&rdquo; (Rom 6:4). Walking in the newness of life is an expression of existing apart from death. The Bible teaches that we are dead before we come to Christ and find forgiveness by grace through faith. There is an eternal schism between God and sinful man, for God is too holy to be around anyone that is not. Because of Jesus, for whom it&rsquo;s all about, we have this opportunity to escape that separation. But the choice won&rsquo;t choose itself nor can it be avoided. Christians have confidence in Christ to get them to Heaven regardless of how they lived. But, the newness of life is for the here and now. Our lives are meant to be an offering to God (1 Corinthians 10:31; Eph 5:2) and a testimony of his glory and goodness (Matthew 5:16). </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you choose life, you choose to serve God with your whole heart, mind, soul, and strength (Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27). A servant&rsquo;s life is lowly, humble and poor. But our master is generous, slow to anger and abounding in patience. Jesus invites us to be servants by setting an example. He invites us to serve alongside him and learn from him; He is our master: &ldquo;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light&rdquo; (Matt 11:28-30). His yoke is his principles, chiefly to deny one&rsquo;s self, pick up one&rsquo;s cross, a symbol of picking up our own demise, and prefer God and people in everything you say, do, and think (Matt 16:24).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By picking up our cross and following Jesus, we lay down our rights and take up his humility and self-sacrifice because of what he did for us. And love is the ultimate expression of this service-- to treat others as precious to God: &ldquo;We love because he first loved us&rdquo; (1 John 4:19). God loves you! He loves me! What? How mindblowing and beyond comprehension a thought is this?</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c58 c76">5. We choose life so we can dwell in God&rsquo;s presence</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my students and I were talking about this the other night-- what is the reason for our obedience and striving for holiness? I had an answer in the back of my head. But what the student had to say shocked me. He said, &ldquo;to be with God.&rdquo; I was blown away by the simplicity and piercing truth of his words. The reason for all of creation and existence, and all history is because God wants to restore people to a right relationship with Him. God fights for us because he loves us.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christian</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;wants to honor and glorify God because of how he loves. We want to give back a piece of what he&rsquo;s given us, if that&rsquo;s at all possible, by listening to his wisdom and instruction, by imitating his example as a child likes to imitate his parents, we abide! Together with God in Christ Jesus! Do not be controlled by temptation, but in Jesus&rsquo;s name, with power and confidence, conquer your weaknesses. If we were still in our sin, we could never worship God properly. But because of this free gift, we can now give something back!

I was watching this video of families celebrating birthdays and when the kid was about to blow out the birthday candle, a brother or sister would swoop in and blow it out instead. This leaves the birthday star in tears. One little girl cried, &ldquo;I wanted to do it!&rdquo; Even adults shopping for groceries seem to adopt the same line of selfish thinking. At the checkout, when a new stand opens, people rush to be first in line. Or fight to grab the last product on the shelf. You&rsquo;ve heard about black friday? Dang, it&rsquo;s crazy. People kill each other to get these deals -- what does this say about us?</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s our culture or the age we live in but everyone seems in such a hurry. I live in California so roads are always filled with cars going every which way. Who knows where they&rsquo;re going, but at the speed and recklessness with which many drive, it better be important, haha! Even in the store, when customers are ready to leave, they&rsquo;re boiling in line. Drive thru windows as well are ablare with honking horns. No one has time to stop and rest, least of all to prefer the needs of the person next to them.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a phenomenon we&rsquo;ve come to know and love called instant gratification. Protestors chant, &ldquo;What do we want? When do we want it?&rdquo; to reflect their desire for change. TV commercials use the same thought process. It shows you a product and tries to convince you to want it and go buy it. Christians running to prosperity gospels are looking for the same thing. It teaches that God guarantees believers blessings of health and wealth. The problem is that possessions, things, success, longevity, and everything else on this Earth will not last. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Here we are temporary, but in heaven things are eternal. Instant gratification teaches us to want things to make our lives better -- God teaches us differently:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also&rdquo; (Matt 6:19-21)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus concludes in the following verses, &ldquo;So do not worry, saying, &lsquo;What shall we eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we drink?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we wear? For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well&rdquo; (Matt 6:31-33). Notice the priority in verse 33. We are not to seek our own needs or wants first, but the wellness of his kingdom and his righteousness which comes to us by trusting in God and repentance. If God takes care of the birds and animals, how much more so will he care for you, his most prized creation?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love the story of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. It is an example for us how to live when we&rsquo;re at wit&rsquo;s end. Sentenced to death by the king, they stand in faith and proclaim their confidence in God&rsquo;s sovereignty: &ldquo;If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us from Your Majesty&rsquo;s hand. But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up&rdquo; (Daniel 3:18). God is able to meet every one of my needs. But even if he does not, I will not bow down to fear or worry or doubt or seek after any other idols. Let that be our motto for the coming days.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God says the same thing to Paul, who asks three times for relief from torment, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness&rdquo; (2 Cor 12:9). Paul responds in the same verse by trusting God and rejoicing in his weakness so that Christ&rsquo;s power might increase. &ldquo;That is why, for Christ&#39;s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong&rdquo; (v 10).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humble yourself, then, and surrender to God for guidance and help. The more we experience hardship, the more we can feel our need for divine assistance, and the more we can feel the power of his grace. Of old testament heroes, the author of Hebrews attributes their strength to weaknesses which God used for his mighty purposes. They, &ldquo;who through faith&rdquo; (Heb 11:33), &ldquo;whose weakness was turned to strength&rdquo; (v 34) conquered kingdoms, shut the mouths of lions, became powerful in battle and routed foreign enemies. <br></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s this phrase in the Bible called, &ldquo;abiding in God.&rdquo; Because I didn&rsquo;t read the Bible I didn&rsquo;t know what this meant nor did I really care. Turns out it&rsquo;s a really important phrase to understand because it reflects God&rsquo;s dedication to us and a right way of living as honor and thanks.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what does it really mean to abide? To love God with your whole heart, mind, soul, and strength, as Jesus lays out in what he calls the most important command (Matt 22:38)? What would it look like in my life to be hidden in Jesus (Col 3:3)? How can I, a sinful man, be united with God who is holy and far greater than anything I can imagine (1 Cor 6:12)? </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul gives us a hint: &ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me&rdquo; (Gal 2:20).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abiding in Christ is different than abiding with or following him. Colosians 3 inspects the same theme, using the words, &ldquo;hidden in Christ&rdquo; (v 3) to capture the oneness that God brings us into of his own good will. Though it is our duty as his creation to honor and worship him and put off sinful habits, it is the free gift of salvation and transformation that abides in us and molds us into the image of Jesus. This is what he meant when he said, &ldquo;abide in me and I in you&rdquo; (John 15:4). He desires that we be like him in how we live, as faithfully unto the Father.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(1 Cor 6:17)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends, if we profess Jesus as lord and put our trust in him fully, we abide in him as one. We were bought with a price of immeasurable value and loved unconditionally. Therefore, all who call unto the name of Jesus should consider themself the Lord&rsquo;s, no longer serving sin but serving God as a slave of righteousness. Matthew Henry adds this call to action: &ldquo;May we make it our business to the latest day and hour of our lives to glorify God with our bodies and with our spirits which are his.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It becomes a privilege to obey God and do his will. Typically we think of obedience and following rules in a negative light. That we are forced under someone else&rsquo;s ruling, not free to do what we want. I remember when I was little, if my dad said no I&rsquo;d go right to mom. Or if she said no, I&rsquo;d go ask dad. We don&rsquo;t like to be told, &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s the same with abiding in God. That is to say there is a fundamental shift in purpose and meaning when we come to God-- the life that we used to live unto ourselves and our own desires is lived unto God and his.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accomplishing this transformation is far easier said than done. It is, indeed, impossible to fully realize in the span of one&rsquo;s life. Nonetheless we are called to perfection and Christ-likeness. This is why we abide. The question that proceeds is, how?<br></span></p><a id="t.f02d323307fce00d22af2a45385718576ec4cebe"></a><a id="t.5"></a><table class="c92"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c82" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c22">What Abiding Is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1">(Rom 8:1-16)</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c22">What Abiding is </span><span class="c22">Not</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1">(Rom 7:14-25)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c82" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Trusting</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Mere Belief</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c82" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Repenting</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Making Excuses</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c82" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Surrendering &amp; Obedience</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Putting my will above God&rsquo;s or changing God to fit my will</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c82" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Live by Faith</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Live by Feelings</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c83 c74 c76 c5 c99"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In John 14, Jesus comforts his disciples and imparts to them the truth about himself as the only way to the Father. He promises them a helper in the third person of the trinity, the Holy Spirit and in chapter 15, gives a metaphor to encourage and guide them. He says, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing&rdquo; (v 5).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of a branch abiding in or remaining as part of the larger vine is a great way to visualize abiding in God. Leaves and branches have no life in it of themselves. Their water, food, and life come from the roots, which soak up and distribute nutrients throughout. The root is the source, not its members. If the branch is cut off, as Jesus relates, it dies because it can no longer absorb what the root provides.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, if we abide in God who is our source of life, we will grow and prosper as a healthy branch bears fruits and leaves. If we do not remain, our branch will bear nothing and the gardener who is God will cut us away from the root and throw us into the furnace (v 6). Let us therefore cling to God as a branch clings to the tree.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.hr0ncddo3g86"><span>It&rsquo;s All About Jesus, Again!</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a joy to be joined unto the Lord! Not of myself but by the grace and love of God. Psalm 23 paints a beautiful picture of abiding in God. Walking through life, hand in hand with our holy Father, &ldquo;He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name&rsquo;s sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me&rdquo; (v 3-4a). Our Father in Heaven is a good father and does not abandon us. He walks with us! How mind blowing that the God of the universe, the Alpha and the Omega, the one who created all things and to whom all creation bows would care for us! It is He who abides in us first. Out of faith we may respond to abide in kind. The opportunity is there, we merely have to take it, saying, &ldquo;Yes, Lord!&rdquo; and step out of our comfort zone, out into uncertain waters like Peter was called by Jesus on the Sea of Galilee (Matt 14:28-29).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his farewell to the eleven disciples, Jesus stands on his Lordship, saying, &ldquo;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore&hellip; And behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age&rdquo; (Matt 28:18--20). The passage reminds us of our mission as Christians to serve God and love others as well </span><span>of God&#39;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;faithfulness and partnership with us in these things. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our confidence in God should be immovable: &ldquo;Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you&rdquo; (Deut 31:6). It should cause us joy and thanks and fulfillment: &ldquo;Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.&rdquo; (Heb 13:5). Does this not strengthen you to trust God and stand on the edge of faith and glory to &ldquo;go therefore?&rdquo; How nearsighted and blind are we who see this life as means for selfish gain? Have we forgotten that we&rsquo;ve been cleansed of our sin and called to a cause greater than ourselves? (2 Peter 1:5-9) May it never be! Rise, O Christian! Today is the day to respond to God&rsquo;s faithfulness and abide in him as he abides in us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">John 15:4-11</span></p><a id="t.cfbe0374fbbd911d2c4a0ff51dae6eb5863a6765"></a><a id="t.6"></a><table class="c33"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c0">Abide</span></p></td><td class="c79" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c41"><span class="c1">&#42295; Remain in fellowship with, reliance upon and obedience to the Lord Jesus<br>&#42295; Reminiscent of how a branch abides in a tree</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c0">In Me</span></p></td><td class="c79" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c41"><span class="c1">&#42295; Our purpose is to be all about Jesus, not to live for ourselves</span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c1">&#42295; Our source of life and the reason we are able to bear fruit</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c0">Bear Fruit</span></p></td><td class="c79" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c41"><span class="c1">&#42295; Fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control</span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c1">&#42295; Evidence of these in one&rsquo;s life brings glory to God</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s all about Jesus means it&rsquo;s no longer about me, means my desires are no longer directed toward my own life or future but to his kingdom and for his righteousness, means this life does not satisfy me anymore only Jesus, the light of the world (John 8:12), the bread of life (John 6:35, 41, 48, 51), the true vine (John 15:1, 5), the resurrection and the life (John 11:25) can fulfill!

Amen. </span></li></ul><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c2 c29" id="h.9gahoqvnd7lr"><span class="c15">Chapter Nine: Walk by Faith, Not by Fear</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting has been the hardest part of the process for me. It;s not just like taking off a coat and putting on a better one. It&rsquo;s an arduous process of taming your flesh, because the natural person responds to the world based on what can be seen, touched, and heard. Mike wakes up in the morning, has breakfast, and goes about his day. Driving to work, he stops at red lights, avoids construction zones, and scoffs at negligent drivers. These things he does without thinking. They are a natural reaction to routine stimuli. Mike lives his life by what he knows and observes. When he experiences trouble, he scrambles for breath, collapsing under fear. He is focused on the limitations of his physical life here in the world. This is because the natural man does not trust God, but himself. For Mike, seeing is believing.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relatable person is me. The conclusion I come to in times of fear is objectively unbiblical. The only way I&rsquo;ve found that tempers my fears in a lasting and productive way is by faith. There is a reality that the natural man does not understand - &ldquo;The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor 2:14). But we who are born of the Spirit into the newness of life have a supernatural sensibility concerning fear. Time and time again, God commands us not to fear but trust him who is sovereign over all things (Deut 31:8; Isa 41:3; 1 Jn 4:18; Ps 18:2). To trust that Jesus is who he says he is and that his promises are sure. That is much much much easier said than done, but through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, God himself living in you, there is truth and rest.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose&rdquo; (Rom 8:28)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living according to God&rsquo;s commandments, bearing good fruits and emulating Jesus are all pretty much impossible tasks, but nevertheless are essential to faith. Think about the tasks given to Moses or to Noah. God told him to free the Israelites from bondage in Egypt. &ldquo;How do I tell the Pharoah to let God&rsquo;s People go? What will he say, what will he do to me?&rdquo; No wonder Moses doubted. Can you imagine the stress of building a mountain-size boat and shepherding two of every animal inside, keeping them well-fed and watered, keeping them calm? Noah must not have gotten any sleep. Even in the New Testament, Jesus&rsquo; disciples were tasked in Acts with casting out demons and raising people from the dead. These things are impossible or nearly impossible. Thankfully, it was not their task to bear alone. Neither is it so for us:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, for, who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ&rdquo; (1 Cor 2:15-16).</span></p><p class="c36 c24 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back on the parable of the vine, God being the vine and believers being the branch - the ability to bear fruit is impossible unless the branch is attached to the vine (John 15:4). If it is cut off, the branch withers away and dies (John 15:6). Similarly, we can accomplish nothing for the kingdom apart from God (John 15:5). But with God, abiding him as the branch abides with the vine, these things are indeed possible.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus proves this to his disciples after explaining how it&rsquo;s easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle for a person to enter the kingdom of Heaven: &ldquo;When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, &ldquo;Who then can be saved? &lsquo;</span><span class="c20">With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;&rdquo; (Matt 19:25-26)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith is not the opposite of fear but it&rsquo;s spiritual remedy. Fear comes in many forms, and the manifestations of the Holy Spirit through faith brings peace and clarity. For Mike, fear is the unknown. It is things he cannot control nor foresee. He is bound by the physical world and cannot understand what&rsquo;s happening spiritually. His solution, therefore, is to walk by faith, not by sight.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed&mdash;a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith&rdquo; (Rom 1:17)</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c29 c97" id="h.83e1sxxqg6jf"><span>Walking in Faith is More Than Putting off Fear</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong&rsquo;s Greek Lexicon defines the word Faith above as a conviction of truth, &ldquo;in the NT of a conviction or belief respecting man&#39;s relationship to God and divine things, generally with the included idea of trust and holy fervor born of faith and joined with it&rdquo; (Strong, G4102).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love the words &ldquo;holy fervor.&rdquo; Is your conviction of God and Christ so strong that a holy fervor for righteousness and honoring God is born in you? </span><span class="c1">Lord, give us a holy fervor for your will to be done that we would say, Yes Lord, and go.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen&rdquo; (Hebrews 11:1)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in a place where I&rsquo;m constantly reminded of my anxieties. But I believe God has a purpose in everything and desires to use me wherever I am. God brought me to a place where I can be thankful for things I would have otherwise been angry and find identity and worth in Him alone. Because of his faithfulness, I no longer judge my life by its circumstances. I love the Psalmist&rsquo;s heart in Psalm 16:8: &ldquo;I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.&rdquo; Despite our challenges, we can be sure that God is with us. Before he ascended, Jesus left us the Holy Spirit as a helper for us to walk by faith.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking by faith and not by sight (2 Cor 5:7) is a Christianese phrase that simply means to live one&rsquo;s life as if guided and led by God and his word instead of forging our own path according to our senses, by what can be seen. We do not put our purpose or value in things here, but in God alone and things pertaining to righteousness. </span><span class="c1">Walking in faith is trusting God in every situation. Walking by sight is judging our circumstances by what we see happening. Are you quick to react and worry or are you tied so closely with Christ that when something happens you resort immediately to trust? By faith we can come near to God and rest in his grace.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith&rdquo; (1 John 5:4)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that picture incredibly powerful. When you&rsquo;re little, everyone and everything looks massive. People are stepping over you; a person&rsquo;s leg is twice the size of your whole body. I remember it being really scary. But when I was near someone familiar, it became something that comforted me. I&rsquo;d look up at them and smile because I knew I was safe and cared for. Our God is just like that. He is powerful and mighty but at the same time loves and cares for us. He&rsquo;s that familiar presence I cling to in the midst of my fears and by faith, I am able to overcome the fearful things of the world.</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the state of the world and the health of the Christian church in the midst of COVID can be discouraging. I have admittedly gotten a bit cynical because of it and needed to check my heart in many ways. To get us on the right track of what saving faith is and what it is not, let&rsquo;s look at some examples from the Bible. Most vividly, faith is exemplified in Jesus.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c66 c22">Jesus Examples of Faith</span></p><p class="c6"><span>&ldquo;But the Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced; therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.

It is encouraging that upon close inspection, there is nothing uniquely different about these heroes than you or me. It is the power of God flowing through them and their conviction to trust God and obey. And we actually have an advantage that people before the ascension of Jesus didn&rsquo;t have: the indwelling of the Holy Spirit! Believers today have God living inside them as a guide and helper - the same power that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you (Rom 8:11). Friends, lean on that power and trust God by stepping out in faith.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obedience follows faith and substantiates it, confirming the transformative power of the Holy Spirit within the believer. James gives a good example: &nbsp;&ldquo;If one of you says to them, &lsquo;Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,&rsquo; but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?&rdquo; (2:16-17). The true Christian confirms their faith by how they live. The false convert claims Christ as Lord but does nothing with it.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To walk by faith is to live in the constant awareness that God lives in you through the person of the Holy Spirit. It is to lean on that power, stepping out into the darkness and letting him shine through your confidence in Christ and boldness in application. In short, it is to persevere: &ldquo;being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Phil 1:6). God gives every Christians responsibilities to perform. Our foremost duties are as ambassadors of God, representatives of his message, and servants for his kingdom. And faith gives us the power to carry these out (1 Cor 2:5; Matt 21:22; Luke 1:37).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found this amazing resource called the Christian&rsquo;s Job description that lists all of our duties before God</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c1">:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.c08d9ed0b5aa8a0e639bfffeb04c33b7170edf6f"></a><a id="t.7"></a><table class="c33"><tbody><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Show love (1 John 4:11)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Be Holy (1 Peter 1:15-16)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Study the word (2 Tim 2:15)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Don&rsquo;t be conformed (Rom 12:1-2)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Reprove darkness (Eph 5:11)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Hunger for righteousness (Matt 5:6)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Forgive (Col 3:13)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Be merciful (Micah 6:8)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Be gentle of spirit (Titus 3:2)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Fear God (Psalm 112:1)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Put off the old man (Eph 4:22)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Renew your mind (Eph 4:23)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Have faith (Rom 1:17)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Be fishers of men (Matt 4:19)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Be kind to each other (Eph 4:32)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Be salt &amp; light (Matt 5:13-14)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c87" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Pray (Luke 18:1)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Be pure in heart (Matt 5:8)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c87" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Fast Matt (6:17-18)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Speak truth (Eph 4:25)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Be a peacemaker (Rom 14:19)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Do not steal (Eph 4:28)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Exercise spiritual gifts (1 Cor 12:31</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Do not fear man (Isa 51:12)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Give glory to God (Psalm 86:8-10)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Be perfect (Matt 5:48)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Deny self (Matt 16:24)</span></p></td><td class="c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Crucify the flesh (Gal 5:24)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c17"><td class="c52 c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24"><span class="c4">Give to others (Luke 6:38)</span></p></td><td class="c30 c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19 c24 c14"><span class="c4"></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at this like a checklist and mark the progress of your faith.

Nothing will be impossible for you&rdquo; (Matt 17:20)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mustard seeds are infinitely small and mountains are preposterously large. But the power of faith, no matter how large, is enough to overcome many obstacles. It is the source of faith that gives it such power and the object of our faith that gives it substance!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I walked up to a mountain and said to the mustard seed, &ldquo;Ok, buddy, time to do your job! I want you to move this mountain! Ready, go!&rdquo; I would only accomplish looking like a crazy person. My expectations for this little seed are disproportionate to its ability. A seed is only good for planting. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that Matthew uses the same seed to illustrate the size and power of the kingdom of Heaven (Matt 13:32). It reminds us of the seed planted for us, our source of power and eternal life, Jesus Christ, the Word that became flesh (John 1:1-5)!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a tree gleans life and power from the seed, so do we from the Word of God and the Holy Spirit alive in us. It empowers us to trust him and express our feeble mustard-seed-size faith that God uses to change hearts, break chains, grow new believers, and restore the world! Never underestimate the power of small faith. It has the power to move mountains, not only in your life but in the lives of others.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith grows just like the mustard seed. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged if you are not yet bold in your faith or fully grown like the tree. God is faithful to lead us and grow us according to his timing and purposes. But don&rsquo;t let that stop you from walking by faith. I know I&rsquo;ve referenced the story of Peter walking out to Jesus on the water many times in this book already, but I&rsquo;ll do it again because I love that moment. Peter showed his small mustard-seed faith by stepping out of the boat when Jesus called. Unsure of what he saw, Peter asks, &ldquo;&lsquo;Lord, if it&rsquo;s you, tell me to come to you on the water.&rsquo;&rdquo; Jesus responds in a soft, comforting voice, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; (Matt 14:28-29)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever heard an inkling to go and do something or talk to someone about Jesus and you&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Yeah, no.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had so many of these disappointing moments where I look back on my life and remember the opportunities God gave me to be faithful but I was too afraid. Peter became afraid too and when he saw the waves he started to sink (v 30). But the fact that he had the guts to step out of the boat is what I always remember. So don&rsquo;t be too preoccupied on your failures before God, ot regret about what you should have done, but have the guts to step out of the boat again today and watch how God trains you to be used powerfully for his kingdom!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s very important to check our foundation. If a house is built on a swamp, it&rsquo;s sure to sink. But if it&rsquo;s built on a rock, as we are meant to be, it will stand strong. There&rsquo;s an old hymn that goes, &ldquo;On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; All other ground is sinking sand.&rdquo; That is why fear is so destructive, why idols are so misleading. Anything we choose to find our identities upon other than Christ is sinking sand! They make us think we are doing well and becoming stronger when in reality our strength is sapped.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s natural for the person to feel discouraged upon failure. But we can&rsquo;t let fear be our foundation! I can&rsquo;t imagine the destitution Peter felt after fear overcame his faith. But God had plans to use Peter as the rock and foundation for his church (Matt 16:18). Imagine what God has in store for you, O Christian, if you&rsquo;d but continue pressing on in faith. What a glorious thing it is to be used mightily for Christ namesake!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t stop, go!

We love inspirational stories of hope and are deeply encouraged by them. We love to cheer for the underdog. Remember the movie, Rudy? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about. The little guy who has to work ten times as hard as the other guys. Despite his challenges, he pushes on in hope of being part of the team. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many movies and TV shows lean on this motive because they know it gets good ratings. Even for superhero movies. Everyone knows that the good guy wins in the end, but it hurts to watch them hurt. It brings us joy when they are joyful. Even though we know the ending, we hold on to hope for the hero&rsquo;s victory. We can, perhaps in a small way, empathize with their journey and that gives us hope for our own battles.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of hope typically does not last very long. We feel good for a while after watching the movie, but when hard times come I don&rsquo;t turn on Spider Man 3 for encouragement. This kind of hope is merely a feeling. The hope we cling to as Christians is, to use a cliche, a way of life. It should permeate every inch of you and be a guiding force in the decisions you make. Facing the past is an important first step because real hope for the future is hard to hold onto otherwise. The hope-filled Christian doesn&rsquo;t let worry control them but the grace and purposes of God. While faith is trust in God, hope is a confident expectation that extends from faith.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you&rdquo; (1 Pet 1:3-4)</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c55 c78 c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Our hope is in the deity of Jesus Christ. If Jesus did not rise from the dead and so conquer sin and death forever as the gospels teach, Paul says our faith is useless and we are to be pitied more than anyone (1 Cor 15:14; 19). But by a Spirit-filled faith we hold firmly to the gospel word of God and our hope grows and manifests itself in how we live. Because of his work on the cross, we can look to the future with hope. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.e42595c209697ee19c9c44884a168b46d4ea7098"></a><a id="t.8"></a><table class="c33"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Worldly Hope</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Biblical Hope</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Wishful</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Committed</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c77"><span class="c1">&bull; Go team, go!

Many see the worst in others simply because they disagree with them. Looking at politics alone, the country and the entire world are so divided that it leads to violence and all out riots. Likely because their hope is in a political leader or a group of thinkers, that supporting them will usher in an era of unseen peace and plenty. As it seems, no president can achieve this. Since the beginning of time there has been turmoil.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus came onto the scene with a different message. Not one of prosperity but a theme of service and denying oneself. Even though he was God in the flesh, Jesus led by example and lowered himself. He washed the disciples&#39; feet, he met with societal outcasts, and denied himself in the most profound way by going to the cross on our behalf, all actions of extreme humility and love.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope in Jesus leads us to admire his example and seek to duplicate it. The transformed Christian loves God and his people as Jesus did and seeks to glorify the father and serve others as he did. Hope takes away our desires for ourselves and replaces them with desires to be like Jesus. It inspires us to live out the Word of God with reckless faith.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.eqdc2l6gfrfh"><span class="c16">Hope is a Six Cylinder Engine</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those movies and TV shows, moments of desperation, when there&rsquo;s no proverbial light at the end of the tunnel, are hard to watch. They challenge our resolve. We desperately want the hero to escape his captors and overcome the enemy. But there often comes a scene before the climax when all hope is lost. The hero may choose to give up and surrender, or, to press on with courage, guided by a sliver of hope. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That choice came for me when I realized how bad my health really was. I knew about the cancer and felt comforted by the doctor&rsquo;s explanation of the type of tumor and the high success rate of removal by radiation and chemotherapy. But after the weeks of medication were over, I was still in the hospital feeling even worse. The doctors explained to my Dad that there were terminal complications with my case. They never told me directly, but it was pretty obvious considering continued operations and lack of improvement.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, it seemed like I didn&rsquo;t have a choice at all. But not the choice you may think. For me, there was only, stick it out and hope for the best. During the cancer treatment, God revealed himself more and more. I&rsquo;m not sure what it was exactly, but for some reason I was always happy. The only time I remember crying in despair was when my pastor visited the hospital to pray with me.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I knew my health was bad, I never really thought about dying or what it would be like. But the prayer encouraged me to press on. I was reminded of the beauty of God&rsquo;s will, his sovereign plan for everyone. That it would be in my best interest if I should live or die. Because to die and go to be with Jesus is the greatest blessing. And to survive and continue life here is to be sanctified and be used mightily by God. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then I took to heart Romans 8:28: &ldquo;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&rdquo; That God&rsquo;s plan for me, if I should live or die, was indeed good, pleasing, and perfect (Rom 12:2). That hope became a great motivation for me, not only hope of getting better, but my eternal hope founded in the triune God. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s all about Jesus! Only he is the source of lasting and eternal hope.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life&rdquo; (1 John 5:20)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope in Jesus is the powerhouse of Christian faith. Without Jesus, it is nothing, and we as well would be nothing. For we would still be in sin, &quot;condemned already&quot; (John 3:18). Right from the beginning of the Bible we learn that God hates sin and that he rejects sinners from his presence. Later on he would show his people ways to be forgiven by sacrificing animals. The lamb would take on the punishment for sin meant for them. But these sacrifices were merely temporary. Only a perfect and holy substitute could take away the eternal punishment of sin forever. Enter Jesus of Nazareth, the fullness of God in human form. He voluntarily assumed the role of the sacrificial lamb that would not just cover our iniquity before God, but cure it at the source once and for all. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you ask why do I still sin? If Jesus defeated sin and death, &nbsp;why is there still sin, &nbsp;why is there still death? It&#39;s because Jesus did the work no one else could do, &nbsp;he bridged the gap between humanity and God and opened the door for us to remain in him for eternity. &nbsp;And it&#39;s in eternity where the fullness of this sacrifice lies. &nbsp;Someone told me long ago that because of Christ, &nbsp;we are free from the power and punishment of sin but not its presence. &nbsp;This is where God commands us to follow Jesus and be like him in his death, &nbsp;to put on Christ and to put off our sinful flesh. Jesus explains this clearly: &quot;Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me&quot; (Matt 16:24).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope helps us press on in faith. It&rsquo;s as if our job is to push a heavy boulder up a hill. If we have no inspired reason to push it, the job becomes dull and tiresome and soon we will loathe the boulder for being so heavy. But with strong conviction and a wavering hope we&rsquo;re able to look past the boulder and actually learn to see it as something beautiful and humbling. Hope also keeps us aware that God pushes us as we push the boulder, so who&rsquo;s really feeling the weight? In fact, in most circumstances God is probably carrying us while he pushes the boulder on our behalf.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in its fullest sense, hope is to look forward to the second coming of Jesus to take away the presence of evil once and for all and bring Christians to a place where there&#39;s no more tears, no more pain, &nbsp;and where we can, because of Jesus, &nbsp;enter back into the full presence of the Father. Yeehaw, what a glorious day!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when experiencing intense hardship, we can exhibit the fruits of the spirit. When his enemies were seeking to kill him, David sang with delight, &ldquo;When I am afraid, I put my trust in you. In God, whose word I praise - in God I trust and am not afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?&rdquo; (Ps 56:3-4). When my world crumbles around me, I still have joy in the Lord. When all is lost, I hold tightly to his faithfulness, for &ldquo;God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act?&rdquo; Does he promise and not fulfill? (Num 23:19).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">&ldquo;Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us&rdquo; (Rom 5:5)</span></p><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 100.54px; height: 141.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 100.54px; height: 141.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Sin, fear, guilt, shame, doubt, unforgiveness in your heart&hellip; There are so many things that can choke out our hope.

I once heard the example of a father who tells his little boy that they&rsquo;re going to Disneyland tomorrow. The child&rsquo;s eyes brighten up. He gives his father hugs, kisses, and thank you&rsquo;s. The child trusts the father&rsquo;s words without an inkling of doubt. He earnestly believes that they will indeed go to Disneyland and have a great time. This is faith. At the same time, the child is filled with excitement. The child can&rsquo;t sleep because he&rsquo;s thinking so clearly of all the fun things to do and how great the experience will be. This is hope. The child has faith that the father is telling the truth and looks forward with joyful hope toward meeting Mickey and riding all the rides and eating yummy food. The child prepares in advance.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that the child doesn&rsquo;t have blind faith or wishful hope. He doesn&rsquo;t trust his Father just because of the good news he brought. His father is there every morning when he wakes up and takes care of all the child&rsquo;s necessities. Though the child may not realize this fully, he knows the father is trustworthy and whose track record is proven. Neither is his hope merely wishful. He doesn&rsquo;t hope that his father will take him to Disneyland. He&rsquo;s already preparing! He&rsquo;s already getting ready! He&rsquo;s already planning his day! For us and our Father, our faith holds fast to his promises and plans while our hope prepares and looks forward with excitement to the task at hand and the glorious return of Christ Jesus!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the choice is changed. Not, will I concede to my challenges and give up versus press on in faith and hope, but the opportunity to be a living sacrifice (Rom 12:1) for God and the gospel. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus likens the Christian&rsquo;s way in life as a narrow path: &ldquo;Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it&rdquo; (Matt 7:13-14). I imagine the narrow path is a dingy dirt path up the side of a treacherous mountain and the small gate is a bunch of twigs woven together. Likewise I imagine the broad road is paved over even land and the wide gate is tall and ornate. If you didn&rsquo;t know the verse beforehand, which path would you like for your life? A life beset with hardship or a life of ease? </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count the cost, as Jesus teaches in Luke 14:28-30. Hey says in verse 33, &ldquo;In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.&rdquo; Set it all on the line to receive the gift Jesus offers. This is the extent of hope in action: all in! Paul would rather count everything as empty and </span><span>loss</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for the sake of knowing God (Phil 3:8-10) and so should we.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night my condition got the better of me again. Because of the cancer, I have what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Panhypopituitarism.&rdquo; One of the results is that I can have a really hard time being motivated to do much of anything, including taking care of myself. It also means my body doesn&rsquo;t deal with stress well. This leads me to despair. I obsess over all my worries and momentarily forget my purpose. But </span><span>thanks be to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;God I am being trained to approach my weaknesses in a new way. Last night I had another breakdown. I shared with the Holy Spirit my desire to be with the Father in Heaven as soon as possible. I was feeling ill and the thought crossed my mind that I may die. He rebuked me with Paul&rsquo;s words in Philippians: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me&rdquo; (1:24-29)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made this little diagram to show the extent of our service to Christ and the gospel (Rom 7:6) and what it practically looks like to &ldquo;to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God - this is your true and proper worship&rdquo; (Rom 12:1)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 432.00px; height: 156.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.jpg" style="width: 432.00px; height: 156.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ever get a chance, </span><span>look up</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Der breite und der schmale Weg&rdquo; from 1866 by Charlotte Reihlen </span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c1">. It&rsquo;s an artist&rsquo;s rendition of the two roads scenario which beautifully displays the meaning of the metaphor. It shows a bird&rsquo;s eye view of two roads, one meandering through a thriving town, and the other through the backwoods. On the left, the people are frolicking and enjoying luxuries, moving every which way. On the right, they are a somber and heavy-hearted community, but mission minded. At the end of the left road are fire and brimstone, at the end of the right, a city of gold. Hope in action drives us to seek the prize of Christ with everything we&rsquo;ve got. For the reward promised is far greater than anything we give up along the way.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools from Ch. 8:<br></span></p><ul class="c43 lst-kix_tn1rkiz7bebq-0"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Commit to experiencing biblical &ldquo;committed&rdquo; hope by putting more faith in Jesus and applying it through hope in action</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t let hardship in this life distract you from your mission from God nor your hope in Jesus and of heaven</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span>Resolve to give more of your life to God for Jesus&rsquo; sake: &ldquo;Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God&#39;s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God--this is your true and proper worship&rdquo; (Rom 12:1)</span></li></ul><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Prayer is Powerful</span></p><ul class="c43 lst-kix_tyspns6h1yql-0 start"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Thank you God for the hope we have in you.

Although these words were corrupted, and in many ways still are today, they define all people as having the irrevocable right to what he calls the pursuit of Happiness. I think what he means is the same opportunity as everyone else to thrive in the world. The pursuit of Happiness does not guarantee happiness or any kind of prosperity, but merely its opportunity.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 192.50px; height: 99.12px;"><img alt="" src="images/image13.png" style="width: 192.50px; height: 99.12px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing about happiness is that it&rsquo;s quite temporary. It is contingent on the factor of us experiencing stimuli that make us happy. And when we are experiencing hardships, we tend to not be happy. Joy on the other hand is permanent and long-lasting. It is a spiritual gift from God and extends throughout eternity; it does not rely on positive circumstances but rooted in oneness with God. He provides joy during hardship (Jas 1:2-4; Rom 5:3-5; 1 Pet 4:13; 2 Cor 12:10); the help from God to overcome every fear and temptation (Phil 4:10-13). Indeed, we are to have joy in every circumstance (Phil 4:4; 2 Cor 6:10)!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus gives many examples about joy and its great value. He tells a parable of a woman who lost a silver coin (Luke 15:8-10). She looks everywhere for it, and when she finds it, she rejoices greatly! Also of a treasure in a field (Matt 13:44) and a lost son (Luke 15:11-32); when they&rsquo;re found, resounding joy ensues. Joy of the Lord is found when we realize what God is doing, what he accomplished by sending Jesus to the cross on our behalf. It quickly becomes our greatest strength and most prized possession:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&ldquo;But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak </span><span>in the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves&rdquo; (John 17:13).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus is the object of our salvation and great joy. At the end of their seventy years of captivity in Babylon, Ezra and Nehemiah finish rebuilding the city&rsquo;s outer walls (Neh 7). The temple is also rebuilt (Ezra 6) and the law is retaught (Neh 8:8). It&rsquo;s a historic moment and a celebration is in order. Nehemiah speaks out: &ldquo;This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength&rdquo; (Nehemiah 8:10). As the law is spoken, the people are depressed at how miserably they&rsquo;ve kept it. In the time of their exile, the jews had forsaken the commands of God in favor of those of their new communities. They forgot God, but God never forgot them. At this time in Scripture, Jesus had not yet come. Yet we see him clearly in the restoration God offers through Nehemiah&rsquo;s words. The joy of the Lord is found when we are restored unto God in adoption as sons and daughters. It is not mere happiness.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 150.50px; height: 141.88px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 150.50px; height: 141.88px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place that best speaks of this joy is the Psalms, most of which were written by King David. Psalm 30 sings about how the Joy of the Lord comes in the morning. He sings, &ldquo;You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; you have loosed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever!&rdquo; (vss 11-12). David had many enemies and we often see him cry to God for help when his life was near its end. But he doesn&rsquo;t end the prayer there. David sings of how great the love of God is, how he saved him from his sin. He sings in Psalm 51: &ldquo;For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight&rdquo; (vss 3-4). He understood his greatest adversary was himself and his own error before God. In verse 10 of the same psalm, he asks, &ldquo;Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think he knew it at the time, but he was singing praises of Jesus, his death, burial, and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins. The sacrifice God desired then is the same one now: a broken and contrite heart (Ps 51:17). &ldquo;The good work wrought in every true penitent, is a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, and sorrow for sin. It is a heart that is tender, and pliable to God&#39;s word. Oh that there were such a heart in every one of us!&rdquo; (Matthew Henry Concise Commentary). God desires that we all have a clear understanding of our sin in order that we may receive his love and forgiveness. The sinner cannot be cleansed until he comes to God in all humility. Our sin and defilement before God becomes a source of great rejoicing then, because it is not held against us anymore! David exclaims his joy, &ldquo;as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us&rdquo; (Ps 102:12).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ&rsquo;s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation&rdquo; (Col 1:21-22)</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.rcj1q6k057rs"><span class="c16">Joy is More Than Happiness</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy of the Lord is at its greatest potency when we understand the depths of his love for us. Just as it brings us great joy to love our sons and daughters, it brings God joy to love us. And just as there is great joy in being loved, so can we experience an unparalleled joy by being loved unequivocally by God.

Though we deserve the opposite from God, his anger and wrath (Eph 2:3), he chooses to love and bless us unconditionally. If we would but trust in Jesus and repent of our iniquity, God is faithful to restore us unto himself. What a priceless gift!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t it funny how during the holidays we&rsquo;re out there searching for the best deals? Well here God offers a priceless deal that one would never imagine passing up. A deal that&rsquo;s truly &ldquo;too good to be true.&rdquo; And don&rsquo;t you, upon seeing this deal, hold your breath and run to take it? Does your heart not leap with excitement and your thoughts, do they not rattle with thanksgiving? It is a joyous thing to be accepted by the living God! A gift beyond measure! </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By grace, we sinners God loved are saved, not by works, because it is the gift of God&rdquo; (Eph. 2:8-9)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the English language, happiness is understood differently than joy. To be happy is to be in a good mood, to be content, to be blissful.</span><span>&nbsp;Joy, on the other hand, is stronger. Biblical joy is a firm confidence that all is well, an unbreakable trust in God&rsquo;s goodness, notwithstanding life&rsquo;s many challenges. Biblical joy revolves around God and his unchanging character. It is centered on the transformative act of Jesus Christ going to the cross on our behalf &nbsp;and belongs only to those who are in Christ. John MacAthur and Grace to You give us a great encouragement: &ldquo;[Joy] is the permanent possession of every believer&mdash; not a whimsical delight that comes and goes as chance offers it opportunity.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Joy, he says, is a flag that flies on the castle of the heart when the King is in residence.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that in the New Testament Greek, a similar difference between happiness and joy is also present. The word for happy is the same as the word for blessed. When Jesus spoke the beatitudes to the crowd (Matt 5:3-11), he said, blessed are those who mourn, blessed are the meek, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, and so on. Translated in Greek, Jesus is saying fortunate and happy are those who mourn because they receive God&rsquo;s favor. &nbsp;In this context, and as defined by a greek lexicon, happiness is a prize for our obedience and faithfulness to God. As we&rsquo;ve seen time and time again, our desires and goals change as we learn to abide, as does what makes us happy.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.ae2ec666dc16b9a4e0430c71c4c7fe8e7ee74b29"></a><a id="t.11"></a><table class="c51"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Happiness (Matt 5:3-11)</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Joy (Psalm 28:7)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Emotion</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Attitude</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Temporary</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Permanent</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Circumstantial</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Supernatural Gift from God</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Physical</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Spiritual</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6"><span class="c1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, joy is appropriately represented in Psalm 28:7. David sings, &ldquo;The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him.&rdquo; Joy is David&rsquo;s natural response to his awareness of God&rsquo;s presence and understanding of the protection and grace he freely offers. It is to leap for joy as people do when they go to a concert or meet their favorite celebrities in person. But because we rejoice for the Lord God of the Universe, our rejoicing ought to be infinitely greater. For the Christian, the gospel news of Jesus is a foundational truth that springs forth unending joy and security. Whenever I am forlorn, God reminds me that my past is in the past. Indeed, Paul puts the reason for our joy succinctly: &quot;What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived -- the things God has prepared for those who love him&rdquo; (1 Cor 2:9).</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.oltlulbfo75w"><span>God Speaks Through Joy</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy is a natural reaction to the good news of Jesus. It is also a command from God that we maintain our joy and express it vividly in how we live. Psalm 100 shows us how:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c28"><span class="c1">Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth. Worship the Lord with gladness;come before him with joyful songs. Know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture. Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name. For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look closely, you can see the many verbs: shout, worship, come before him, know, we ARE his people, enter, with praise, give thanks, praise his name, the Lord IS good, his love endures, his faithfulness continues. These verbs are actions that we are meant to do and that God has done, is doing, and will continue to do.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commandments for us are clear: to let the Joy of the Lord flow through every word we speak, everything we do, and to everyone we meet. The good news of Christ ought to transform how you live in that every inch of you is covered with joy and praise and thanksgiving! Have you heard the saying, you become like those you spend the most time with? Why is that? Because character is contagious. Let our joy be so contagious! Let all those who see us and talk to us be overwhelmed with this joy and hear our praises and be filled with conviction of sin that they might run to be forgiven in the same mighty ways we have been!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord always! Again I will say, &lsquo;Rejoice!&rsquo; Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand&rdquo; (Phil 4:4-5)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Paul notices the imminence of Jesus&rsquo; return and the end of all things (1 Pet 4:7). He stresses the importance of living boldly for Christ now. The time for action is now, he says. James teaches the same: &ldquo;You do not even know what will happen tomorrow! What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes&rdquo; (Jas 4:12). If our life is indeed but a whisper, shouldn&rsquo;t we take every effort to make it count? I submit that the joy of the Lord is the means by which we can do these things. It encourages us to press on even when it&rsquo;s hard, to get things done in the name of Jesus, all for the glory of God. It keeps us content -- joy of the Lord is a sign of forgiveness and transformation by the Holy Spirit, something we cannot be thankful for enough!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience&rdquo; (Heb 4:11)<br></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the account of creation in Genesis 1, the world yearns for Jesus&rsquo; triumphant return. For on that glorious day, evil will be thwarted forever and eternal justice will be had by God. He will strike down the Devil and all his minions and reign over an era of newfound peace and prosperity. Only in Christ may we experience rejuvenation in this life and unadulterated union with God forever in the next. The Psalmist sings of this as well in 118:22-24:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes. The Lord has done it this very day; let us rejoice today and be glad&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more popular translation of verse 24 is, &quot;This is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.&quot; More often than not, this verse is misunderstood. The day &ldquo;this is&rdquo; is not today or any old calendar day. He&rsquo;s not just telling us to be happy today, but to celebrate Jesus! He&rsquo;s talking about the glorious day Christ defeated death on the cross. He&rsquo;s speaking of the age of forgiveness that Jesus ushered in by paying our penalty for sin! He&rsquo;s speaking of the era of end times, the time I believe we are living in now, and is looking forward to the glorious day of Jesus&rsquo; return and the final defeat of sin and evil. Sure, it&rsquo;s a good idea to rejoice about a new day of life, but how much more so are the forgiveness of sin and Christ&rsquo;s triumphant return a cause for joy!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the command to be joyful isn&rsquo;t just for our sake. Joy is another reason why we need to be bold (Josh 1:9; Prov 28:1; Acts 28:31), make disciples (Matt 28:16-20), and give back to God everything we have and more (John 15:8).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we love to be around people who are happy and joyful? Why do we hate to be around people that are consistently negative? Dogs are like this as well. You can tell a dog, &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; but if you don&rsquo;t say it in a loving voice the dog will look like it&rsquo;s afraid. God speaks to us with exceeding love, tenderness, and affection. Joy is an extension of his voice in us and through us. Like faith and hope, joy points us first the cross and then to the mission field. Because of what Christ accomplished, we want to serve, we desire to be made low, we rejoice at the thought of laying down our lives for another.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Phil 1:9)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What joyful expectation! What faith! What hope! How great is our God that he would perfect us according to his good plan. A hymn titled &ldquo;How Great Thou Art&rdquo; proclaims in a verse: &ldquo;When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation, and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart. Then I shall bow, in humble adoration, &nbsp;And then proclaim: &quot;My God, how great Thou art!&quot; Let this be our war cry for the coming days.

At the end of a long race, the final three surge forward with every bit of energy they possess. They give their sweat and blood for a chance to take home the gold. But only one winner can claim it. If you look closely at the finalists standing on their pedestals, the gold medal winner is elated, the silver medalist is upset, and the bronze competitor is just as elated as the gold winner. That&rsquo;s because the bronze winner is happy to have won anything. The silver medalist is angry because he or she was so close to winning it all! &ldquo;I have a problem&rdquo;, says comedian Jerry Seinfeld, &ldquo;with that silver medal. It&#39;s like, Congratulations, you almost won. Of all the losers, you&#39;re the number one loser. No one lost ahead of you.&rdquo; This sentiment is so true in life and faith as well.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine getting to Heaven, hearing the words, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant,&rdquo; and being placed two seats away from Jesus. The majority of those in the crowds are so excited just to be there, but if we had the same human sentiments in Heaven, I would be so incredibly jealous of the person in front of me. My life would taunt me: &ldquo;If only you were a little more bold in your faith!&rdquo; Thankfully, I doubt it will be like this in Heaven. No one will be jealous of another, there will be no sinful limitations. But thinking now from my very limited perspective, it would be such a horrible torture to have the weight of that one mistake on my shoulders forever, that one thing I didn&rsquo;t do which keeps me from the seat of honor. The prominence of pride in humanity I think is precisely why Jesus demands we be humble. Without a proper lowering, God in his infinence cannot be properly grasped. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearing the climax of the gospel of Matthew, Jesus explains to his disciples his plans to go to Jerusalem and suffer. Peter doesn&rsquo;t like this at all and begins to rebuke him (as a side note it is never a good idea to talk back to God). Jesus responds in holy fire, seeing the devil behind Peter&rsquo;s desire to stop God&rsquo;s sovereign plan. After this, Jesus turns to the disciples and proclaims, </span><span>&ldquo;If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it&rdquo; (Matt 16:24-25). Upon first inspection, this claim is very confusing. What does he mean that to save my life I must lose it? What is he getting at when he makes prerequisites to following him? Shouldn&rsquo;t my following him be to his glory regardless? Peter was doing the right thing in trying to save Jesus&rsquo; life, right? It seems counterintuitive and outright offensive to the prideful human mind.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Peter didn&rsquo;t realize is that by standing in front of Jesus&rsquo; plans, he was saying I know better than God. He was saying that his plans for Jesus were better than the Father&rsquo;s plan. Thinking about it, if Jesus never died on the cross, sins would not be forgiven. The human life of Jesus would have been spared but at what cost for humanity? In retrospect, God&rsquo;s will for himself in the person of Jesus was one of compassion and love for humanity. God took it upon himself to suffer in order that we might be spared. Peter&rsquo;s pride blinded him to the love behind Jesus&rsquo; words: &ldquo;that He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life&rdquo; (Matt 16:21c). Pride always stands in God&rsquo;s way; Humility comes after realizing He is right. Peter must have felt so small when Jesus rebuked him. And when the time came to prove himself and the loyalty that he bragged about in verse 22, he ultimately failed. So even though he probably felt humbled in that moment, it&rsquo;s hard to say if he had true humility at this point in time. So what&rsquo;s the difference?</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pharisees were the Jewish religious rulers of Jesus&rsquo; time. They were seen as the best humanity had to offer, the holiest, most like God you could possibly be. And they thought this of themselves as well. They walked the walk and talked the talk, as if to say, &ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m awesome and I know it.&rdquo; They went out of they&rsquo;re way sometimes to flaunt their holiness. Jesus mentions this in Matthew 6. He says, &ldquo;do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others&rdquo; (vs 5) and &ldquo;when you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting&rdquo; (vs 16). This is what the Pharisees would do, they would put on a show of outward righteousness and discount the need for true inward humility. Jesus calls them out in chapter 23. He shows the people and the disciples that the Pharisees are fakes. They preach but do not practice (vs 3), they bark but don&rsquo;t bite, they look good on the outside but inside they are rotten. He even calls them &ldquo;whitewashed tombs,&rdquo; (vss 27-28) meaning that their righteous deeds only serve to make their spiritually dead corpses look pretty. Dang if that&rsquo;s not a diss I don&rsquo;t know what is, haha!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Jesus is saying this to people like the Pharisees who obeyed the law perfectly, what would he say to us, who try so hard to make our lives look desirable before others and perfect before God? Humility, God is saying, is a matter of the heart, not the deed. So we need to check ourselves on a frequent basis to make sure our hearts are rightly humbled before God. Beware of being like the pharisees. I think of what their social media page might be like. Probably post a picture of one praying. Caption reads, &ldquo;Took the whole day to honor God. Trying to be a good example #humblebrag.&rdquo; Do we not do this as well? Not trying to brag but&hellip; How many selfies do you think the world posts in a day? I don&rsquo;t even want to know.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words&rdquo; (Matt 6:7)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.1ea3a28ba32ab66c76deb5c168cdfda090ef3fe1"></a><a id="t.12"></a><table class="c33"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Fake Humility</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Honest Humility</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Glorifies / Trusts in Self</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Glorifies / Trusts in God</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Outward Expression</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Inward Attitude</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Gains Nothing</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Gains Strength from God</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Helps No One</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">So Encouraging, So Powerful </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also important is the type of humility that is self-condemning. This is not good, God does not want this from you. I&rsquo;ve heard so many stories from fellow believers who are so focused on their sin and failures before God and dwell in that mindset. They are not joyful or thankful or filled with power. God says we are free from slavery to sin. So beating yourself up for your failures, or being afraid that God will not accept you is not healthy nor is it biblical. Self-condemnation is so dangerous. If this is you, please pray that God would show you the depth of his love for you. That he would reassure you of the power of the cross. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love. He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us&rdquo; (Ps 103:8-12)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the right type of humility, we can look to John the Baptist. He came before Jesus and was given great praise and honor by the people. They revered him and when Jesus came on the scene and started baptising people, they went to John and told him how Jesus was stealing his spotlight. John answers them, saying, &ldquo;He must become greater; I must become less&rdquo; (John 3:30). John knew his place, he understood the role God gave him to work it. He was to prepare the way for Jesus, not take his place. And he did it well. If I was in his position, I would be so tempted to take the place of glory. But John maintained his humility as a servant of God, a good lesson for us all.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another type of humility that does not honor God. This one confuses humility with being overly self-critical. It sees every little mistake as enormously damning. I relate to this very much, especially as a man. God commands men to be protectors and providers and it&rsquo;s so easy to see my failures to live as a holy example for others as an inherent failure in my being. I have so many students that struggle with this. We all have things that tempt us, and the process of letting go of lust and putting on righteousness can be slow and arduous and full of failure. One thing we always have to remember when we think we are too far gone for God to rescue, or that our sin is too great for God to pass over is that &ldquo;as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us&rdquo; (Ps 103:12). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.756fe70c22ee1af0f7dfb5e77b7d5bbfc139f22a"></a><a id="t.13"></a><table class="c33"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c39" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Proud, Self-Righteous, Exaggerated Piety, Self-Glorification</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For they being ignorant of God&rsquo;s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God&rdquo; (Romans 10:3)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c39 c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c16">Lowly in Spirit, Heart of Service, Trusts God, Obeys God</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding&rdquo; (Proverbs 3:5)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c34"><td class="c39" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c20">Discouraged, Focused on Mistakes, Needs to Trust Jesus<br>&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">What a wretched man I am!

For, &ldquo;there is no condemnation now for those who live in union with Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Rom 8:1). All are forgiven in the light of Jesus. So when you are feeling self-critical, simply trust that what Christ came to accomplish is indeed finished. Remember the two thieves that were being crucified with Jesus? One thief mocked Jesus but the other acknowledged Jesus&rsquo; deity? Well to the one who believed, Jesus said, &ldquo;Jesus answered him, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise&rdquo; (Luke 23:43). He gives everyone that same promise who puts their faith in Jesus, no matter what they&rsquo;ve done. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know exactly what the two thieves did, but the fact that they were being crucified for it gives us a clue. Crucifixion was a specific type of execution reserved for the worst and most reviled criminals. If Jesus was willing to forgive him for his egregious sins, surely he will accept you. Note also that this man asks for forgiveness at the end of his life. There is no time limit to be forgiven, no vial of sand running out. God is ever patient and ever gracious. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever (Heb 13:8) and will never run out of forgiveness, even if you&rsquo;ve sinned a thousand times and a thousand times again! So throw away that self-condemnation and rise again in true humility before God and man.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.93tqjjh01xdv"><span class="c16">Lessons from Scripture</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book of Job is all about humility. It starts off with this godly man, Job, who honors God in everything he does. God has blessed him richly and he enjoys life. Then, in a flash, God takes it all away. For the rest of the book, Job argues with his friends about why God has done this. They assume it must be because he sinned and hasn&rsquo;t repented and his talking back is an act of rebellion against God. What they didn&rsquo;t know is that God allowed Satan to take these things away. He did this for an important purpose which is revealed in the last few chapters.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God takes Job aside. I imagine that he grabs Job by the shoulder and looks him right in the eye. Then God speaks, &ldquo;Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge? Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me&rdquo; (38:2-3). He then asks Job a bunch of rhetorical questions to display his power and authority. God shows Job the majesty of the universe in all it&rsquo;s complexity and the goodness of his works, all the time chastising him, as if to say, &ldquo;Who do you think you are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then God gives Job a chance to respond. God stands in front of him like a giant as the little man trembles below. Job finally says, &ldquo;&ldquo;I am unworthy&mdash;how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth. I spoke once, but I have no answer&mdash;twice, but I will say no more&rdquo; (40:4-5). And after more proof of his frailty before the Almighty Lord, Job speaks again, this time answering God&rsquo;s questions directly:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know, Lord, that you are all-powerful; that you can do everything you want. You ask how I dare question your wisdom when I am so very ignorant. I talked about things I did not understand, about marvels too great for me to know. You told me to listen while you spoke and to try to answer your questions. In the past I knew only what others had told me, but now I have seen you with my own eyes. So I am ashamed of all I have said and repent in dust and ashes&rdquo; (42:1-6)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses is said to be the meekest man in all the world (Num 12:3). God was about to destroy the Israelites for their unfaithfulness and afterwards give Moses power and blessings by making him great (Ex 32:9-10). Instead of letting his people die and accept the gift for himself, Moses defended them and God relents. Who of us would deny such a wonderful gift? Today is a cut-throat world of business where people throw each other under the bus to get a promotion, where politicians bad-mouth each other to get an edge, and homeless people are passed by without a glance or friendly greeting. Surely Moses would stand up for the least of these! Meekness is not weakness but being small in your own eyes.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul, before he was the apostle Paul, was a Christian killer. One day, God spoke to him saying, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do&rdquo; (Acts 9:5-6). God humbled him by blinding him for three days, neither did he eat or drink anything during that time. Now called Paul, he quickly got the message and turned his life around to be a blessing and a helper for these early Christians.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most of all, we learn about humility by the example of our Lord and Savior, Jesus of Nazareth, the holy Christ. Even though he was Almighty God in the flesh, Jesus never claimed power for himself. He came into the world in the most humble way-- born to a poor family in a stable full of smelly animals. He lived in submission to the Father and did everything to build up the church and show love to people who needed it most. And when it was time for him to die, Jesus continued to serve the Father and serve humanity. On the cross, Jesus took on all the sins of the world and bore their consequence on himself. He suffered, bled, and died as a testimony of the Father&rsquo;s immeasurable love for his most cherished, so much so that he made this way for us to be restored unto himself. All because of Jesus&rsquo; humility and obedience to the Father and his love for others. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father&rsquo;s commandments and remain in His love. I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete. This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&rdquo; (John 15:9-13)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Bible heroes understand the order of power. Job was complaining to God and treated him like a referee. He said to God, &ldquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; and insulted God&rsquo;s sovereign will. But after God pulled him down a few hundred levels, Job sees who God is. Paul was a Christian killer. He had no understanding of the truth, but when he was humbled, God used him mightily to build up the church. And most of all the example of Jesus! Who, &ldquo;though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant&rdquo; (Phil 2:5-7).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are humbled, the order of authority becomes very clear. We realize what little power we have and how much we rely on God, even for our very breath! If it wasn&rsquo;t for God&rsquo;s loving care, he might have destroyed humanity at the beginning and started over. If it wasn&rsquo;t for God&rsquo;s loving care, there would be no forgiveness of sin and all would suffer in Hell forever. If it wasn&rsquo;t for God&rsquo;s loving care, there would be nothing good in existence. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scripture reminds us who we are in comparison to God-- bumbling sheep in dire need of a shepherd. If I could tell you one thing about sheep it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re helpless. If one falls over, it will die if someone doesn&rsquo;t pick it up. Sheep get lost very easily and if they&rsquo;re not being watched, one can walk right off a cliff without noticing. They need the shepherd&rsquo;s constant guidance. Jesus is our good shepherd. He protects and lays his life down for the sheep. When the wolves come to devour the sheep, the good shepherd defends them. He doesn&rsquo;t leave us out in the open ready to be picked off, because he is a faithful shepherd (John 10:11-13). What a relief it is to be in the care of a good shepherd, for we are indeed helpless like sheep.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul describes just how susceptible to danger we are without Christ. He writes, &ldquo;until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God&hellip; we will no longer be infants, tossed about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching and by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming&rdquo; (Ephesians 4:13-14). Without the steady hand of truth protecting us and guiding us, it&rsquo;s so easy to be taken advantage of by sweet lies. The media is famous for this. TV shows and movies prey on our lusts and fears and try to convince us to believe things that contradict God. And without some kind of bearing, we can&rsquo;t see where we are going and fall off the cliff like a sheep. Humility recognizes the dangers around us and trusts God to keep us. It recognizes him as the leader with gladness and submits to his guidance with shouts of joy. Be like sheep that trust the shepherd. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 150.00px; height: 290.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image14.jpg" style="width: 150.00px; height: 290.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Bible is essentially a book about relationships. Notice how humility and relationships are multi-directional. We are to relate vertically in submission to God and horizontally with peace and love toward other people. This was the plan from the beginning, but because sin and darkness entered the world, these relationships became skewed. Instead of listening to God&rsquo;s instruction, people despise it. Instead of treating each other kindly, everyone seems interested only in themselves. Humility is an opportunity to set ourselves upright and fit back into our original design. Why do I keep saying it&rsquo;s all about Jesus? When we operate outside this diagram, with submission, peace, and love, and instead prefer a life of self-focused living, the doors to fear, shame, anger, pride, and lust grow wider and wider. Simply put, humility is a foundation for joyful, faithful living.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Tools from Ch. 12:</span></p><ul class="c43 lst-kix_tn1rkiz7bebq-0"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">True humility trusts God and follows his way</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">True humility understands God&rsquo;s promises and the depths of his love for us</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">True humility is self-sacrificial living and service to God and other people</span></li></ul><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Prayer is Powerful:<br></span></p><ul class="c43 lst-kix_tn1rkiz7bebq-0"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span>Lord, I know that Pride is </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c2 c29" id="h.7vefwcdack6x"><span class="c15">Chapter Thirteen: Peace</span></h2><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universal symbol for peace was originally used by the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the Cold War. The designer, Gerald Holtom explains the origin of his idea: &ldquo;I was in despair. Deep despair. I drew myself: the representative of an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya&rsquo;s peasant before the firing squad. I formalised the drawing into a line and put a circle round it.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve never seen or heard of Goya&rsquo;s painting, I encourage you to look it up because it really gives meaning to Holtom&rsquo;s design. What can you do amid the threat of war except wait and despair? </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tensions were way too high; both sides had excessive distrust for one another. Peace was critical, not just preferable. I was watching a documentary on the atom bomb titled, &ldquo;Countdown to Zero&rdquo; which listed all the times we came close to all out nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Apparently, false warnings were received regularly. In 1995, America released a formal notification to Russia and other countries that it was launching a rocket from Norway to study the northern lights. The Soviet military received a false report and took this as an act of war. By the grace of God, then President Boris Yeltsin, refused to believe it. According to leadership standards of practice, he should have retaliated. Whatever the case, &nbsp;Yeltsin concluded that the missile was not a first strike and did not fire back, an action that would have had worldwide ramifications. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world today is exceedingly chaotic. If we&rsquo;re not at war with other countries we are at war amongst each other and with ourselves. People are divided along nearly every line and violence is so quick to arise when someone steps over them. People look to their own wisdom for guidance instead of trusting God and wonder why bad things happen. People openly mock God and encourage others to do so and yet wonder where evil comes from. They think themselves righteous and blame God for their problems; it&rsquo;s no surprise that God&rsquo;s wrath still burns against sinners.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be less interest in peace today than winning for one&rsquo;s side. We&rsquo;ve been taught that peace comes through war, that it&rsquo;s simply the absence of conflict. That once your side wins, the conflict stops and there is peace. In the Bible, peace is never only the absence of trouble. The Hebrew &ldquo;shalom&rdquo; and the Greek &ldquo;eirene&rdquo; always seek to restore brokenness and everything which makes for the highest good. There are, then, three distinctions of peace to consider: Peace in the World, Peace with God, and the Peace of God.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.f97f0d8c939985790e2866563fcc70acec96c855"></a><a id="t.14"></a><table class="c33"><tbody><tr class="c34"><td class="c68" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c22 c20">World Peace</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Prosperity</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 130.00px; height: 117.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 130.00px; height: 117.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></td><td class="c68" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c22 c20">Peace with God</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Forgiven</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 130.00px; height: 130.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.png" style="width: 130.00px; height: 130.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></td><td class="c68" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c22 c20">Peace of God</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Eternal Security</span></p><p class="c3 c14"><span class="c55 c91"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 130.00px; height: 113.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 130.00px; height: 113.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word </span><span class="c25">peace</span><span>&nbsp;is used in different ways in Scripture. Its first use is in the context of comfort, well-being, and plentiful resources (1 Ki 4:20; 25). It is a temporary state of blessedness that will be permanently enjoyed under the Messiah&rsquo;s rule (Mic 4:3; 4). This is </span><span class="c25">peace in the world.</span><span>&nbsp;The second and third usages of </span><span class="c25">peace</span><span>&nbsp;in Scripture are spiritual and refer to how people relate to God. </span><span class="c25">Peace with God</span><span>&nbsp;is the justification that comes through faith in Jesus. He took on the punishment meant for sinners thus removing legal condemnation. The third use is the </span><span class="c25">peace of God. </span><span class="c1">When Jesus ascended into Heaven, God sent the Holy Spirit to dwell with believers as a helper and guarantee of salvation. This is the peace that &ldquo;surpasses all understanding&rdquo; (Philippians 4:7); it secures Christians in times of trouble and keeps them eternally minded.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.c3vvx69uklp0"><span>Peace on Earth Comes from Peace with God </span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace on Earth and goodwill toward men is a popular saying during the Christmas season. It comes from the narrative of Jesus&rsquo; birth. The Gospel accounts of Matthew and Luke record this event from different perspectives. In Matthew, an angel visits Joseph and explains to him the nature of Mary&rsquo;s pregnancy and tells him to name his son Jesus, &ldquo;because he will save his people from their sins&rdquo; (1:21). In Luke, an angel visits nearby shepherds and shares the good news about the Messiah&rsquo;s birth. Then out of nowhere, what seems to be a choir of angels appears and praises God: &ldquo;&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests&rdquo; (Luke 2:14). The angel&rsquo;s words to Joseph offer depth to the words spoken to the shepherds. Looking at the birth of Jesus and the forgiveness of sin as the cause for peace on Earth shows God&rsquo;s sovereign hand in motion.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was peace on Earth in the beginning. After he finished creating the universe in all its detail and added people as the cherry on top, God looked at all of it and said, &ldquo;It is very good.&rdquo; His words are remembered in the Hebrew word for peace, </span><span class="c25">shalom. </span><span>Cornelius Plantinga defines it in his book, </span><span class="c25">Not the Way it&rsquo;s Supposed to Be</span><span class="c1">:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shalom means universal flourishing, wholeness and delight&hellip; the way things ought to be&rdquo; (p. 10). War was never meant to exist in the world, but when Adam and Eve disobeyed God, they proved that they didn&rsquo;t fully trust God. They wanted the blessing without God. In our minds Adam and Eve&rsquo;s sin is a simple mistake, but to God, one single infraction, however light, creates darkness in the heart, and darkness cannot survive near a light so pure. So God and man were divided and war broke out as people sought to be their own gods, desiring the blessing without the bless-er. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin is contention between God and man and the reason why lasting peace between people and nations is a fevered dream. An easy way to understand it is that all sin is selfishness but, love and peace are selfless. God&rsquo;s chosen people, Israel, is selflessly loved by God who desires peace. But their continued disobedience and lack of trust in God leaves the two divided in conflict. There are many times in the Old Testament where Israel enjoys peace and rich blessings from God. God&rsquo;s commandments kept them safe and were ultimately for their own good. Lasting peace in Heaven and Earth was foreshadowed on Christ&rsquo;s death, when God reached down from Heaven and welcomed his fallen people back to Him. It will be fully realized when Jesus returns and restores his people back into his holy presence.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware of forgetting God in your pursuit of peace and happiness. The Israelites, God&rsquo;s chosen people, did so when they scoffed at his teachings and did what they wanted. Disobedience leads to greater and greater suffering. Good parents discipline their children for correction and is meant to improve their lives, adding wisdom and strong character for times when the parents aren&rsquo;t around to call on. Though the belt may sting, you better believe I&rsquo;m not forgetting that lesson! God disciplines the Israelites in the same way. From a human perspective, sending them to wander in the desert for 40 years is a bit excessive. Not to mention sending the Assyrians and Babylonians to conquer and capture their land and families. But God is looking at the eternal timeline. To him, &ldquo;a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance&rdquo; (2 Pet 3:8-9). God&rsquo;s foremost desire for the Israelites is to restore them to peace. The same is for us today. Malachi puts it succinctly:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,&rsquo; says the Lord of hosts&rdquo; (Malachi 3:7)</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c28"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace is restored to the world when people return to peace with God - these are directly connected. &ldquo;Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray&rdquo; (James 5:13). Classic example: the parable of the prodigal son. A son forsakes his father&rsquo;s house in favor of pleasure. The son experiences great hardship as a result and receives blessing only when he returns to the Father. The glorious thing about this story is that the Father offers peace freely. The son can&rsquo;t restore it because he is the one at fault. Is this not a picture of us and our Heavenly Father? Biblical peace is distinct in how it restores a broken situation. Jesus made peace between God and man by fulfilling the justice meant for us on the cross. Christians are likewise to keep peace with God and others by living self-sacrificially in all humility. </span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.10fbvxlhhgpq"><span class="c16">An All Surpassing Peace</span></h3><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">There is no peace found in trusting one&rsquo;s self. Trying to please God by living well is futile. Likewise is looking for peace in one&rsquo;s achievements. That is because there will always be more to be done. It&rsquo;s like crossing a desert on foot. It takes all of your energy to pass over that mountainous dune. You think you&rsquo;re getting closer to civilization with every step, but when you reach the top, you only find that another has taken its place. Solomon, wisest man in all of history, says of finding meaning in life: &ldquo;I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, chasing after the wind&rdquo; (Ecc 1:14). As a king, Solomon did and saw it all. He did so many great things for the nation of Israel and under his rulership, it acquired much wealth and influence. He had a great many possessions, access to every pleasure and things that bring happiness, and yet as an older man looking back, he calls them worthless. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God gave the Jews standards for choosing a king, and it&rsquo;s no coincidence that He stresses the importance of a king who does not &ldquo;acquire great numbers of horses for himself&rdquo; nor &ldquo;take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold&rdquo; (Deut 16-17). Overcome by his lusts, King Solomon broke all three of these guidelines and opened the door for conflict between him and God. Neither is it a coincidence how the Bible records the weight of his yearly earnings, 666 talents of gold. Not only is that a lot of gold (about 25 tons), it&rsquo;s the same number used to describe the antichrist in Revelation 13 and points to &ldquo;the man of lawlessness&rdquo; in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4. At the beginning of his reign Solomon fully acknowledged God and was blessed. But because of his exceeding wealth and power, he lost sight of God, the reason God was angry with Solomon: &ldquo;because he had shifted his allegiance away from the Lord&rdquo; (1 Ki 11:9). His new allegiance was to his wealth. Love of money is the root of all evil (1 Tim 6:10) because it ties us to the world instead of to God.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You adulterous people, don&rsquo;t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us? But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: &lsquo;God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble&rsquo;&rdquo; (James 4:4-6)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his own accord and great love, God brought peace where peace was doomed; we doomed it. We doom it everytime we disobey God instead of trusting him. Peace surpasses when we act in harmony with God, according to the way things were meant to be instead of rebellion. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul uses the expression, &ldquo;peace that surpasses all understanding,&rdquo; (Phil 4:7) in reference to the resulting product of asking God for help in the midst of our worries. He points us back to the cross and reminds us of God&rsquo;s unchanging verdict against the crimes of humanity: not guilty, by grace through faith. God holds no account of disobedience on the one who trusts in Jesus and repents. Nor does he sentence them to condemnation reserved for such an infraction. Isaiah also talks of this &ldquo;perfect peace&rdquo; (Isa 26:3) &nbsp;that comes from trusting God. The burdens of legalism are relaxed and the believer is humbled, like a child sitting in the presence of a loving and protective Father. Peace for the one who trusts God isn&rsquo;t necessarily a physical peace between people or countries, but a spiritual peace that finds rest in God&rsquo;s plan and supreme authority over creation. Forgiveness through Christ alone is once and for all - nothing can separate us from the love of God (Rom 8:31-39). Our </span><span class="c25">peace with God</span><span>&nbsp;reminds us to think eternally and see our lives from God&rsquo;s perspective, enduring suffering and looking forward with the</span><span class="c25">&nbsp;peace of God</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s perfect peace breaks chains of sin and eternal death and also frees the one who trusts from personal chains like regret or hurt that come from sinful thinking, that is, judging one&rsquo;s life from any perspective other than God&rsquo;s. When I was sick with cancer, I only ever felt despair when I focused on the gloom of my present circumstance. I was often encouraged to praise God for the things I did have, and to look at the beauty of his good creation. Setting my gaze back on heavenly things brought me great peace and security. When I was lifeless from chemotherapy and radiation, I could say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so thankful to God!&rdquo; And when my condition became terminal, I could say, &ldquo;I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, LORD, make me dwell in safety&rdquo; (Psalm 4:8). There is nothing more settling than the peace of God - no physical substance or immaterial phenomena.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look again at Philippians 4, at Paul&rsquo;s prescription of peace that surpasses. He first describes the peace of God. Like a pharmacist, verses 2-6 provide the medication&rsquo;s instructions - &ldquo;be of the same mind as the Lord&rdquo; (vs 2), labor for the gospel (vs 3), rejoice in the Lord(vs 4) with forbearance to all (vs 5), and the final ingredient, &ldquo;Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God&rdquo; (vs 6). Make a habit of doing these things and &ldquo;And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (vs 7). </span><span class="c25">Peace with God </span><span>is a factual state of existence that all who repent and trust in the name of Jesus share. It is not an emotion that comes from within, nor is it something we can acquire of our own doing. It is a gift of immeasurable cost - the blood of Jesus - and exceeding worth - salvation from death and entrance into Heaven. </span><span>The</span><span class="c25">&nbsp;peace of God</span><span class="c1">, on the other hand, ebbs and flows like a river. It&rsquo;s source is inexhaustible, though effective only when we trust God and actively pursue Him. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this story from Mark 11 about Jesus and the fig tree. The set up is that Jesus sees a fig tree that looks good from afar. But when he gets closer, he realizes that the tree has no fruit. So Jesus curses the tree. Soon after, he comes to a temple filled with people buying and selling things like it was a market. Jesus is furious and stops the party. As he&rsquo;s leaving, one of his disciples points out the fig tree Jesus cursed except now it&rsquo;s entirely withered. Then Jesus gives a peculiar lesson (verses 22-25) that seems unfit for the context:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c61 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Have faith in God,&rdquo; Jesus answered. &ldquo;Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, &lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,&rsquo; and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c36 c24 c14 c61"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barren fig tree was a representation of the Jews who looked religious on the outside, as was the polished temple. Inwardly, they were schemers and lovers of money and had, like the tree, produced nothing good. Jesus gives his subsequent lecture to remind his disciples that active faith is the mark of a true follower of God. This is the person who has the inexhaustible </span><span class="c31 c25">peace of God.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said I was thinking about this passage, I was wondering what Jesus meant by &ldquo;believe you have received it, and it will be yours.&rdquo; That sounds awfully like the &ldquo;Name It and Claim It&rdquo; doctrine of false teachers. 1 John 5:14-15 reiterates Jesus&rsquo; words: &ldquo;And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.&rdquo; Notice the disclaimer, &ldquo;according to his will.&rdquo; When we pray for things God already desires for us, he is faithful to answer and give us those good things. Things like love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, etc. Things we need to move mountains in our lives and embrace boldness for the sake of the cross.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently in this moment, I&rsquo;m battling depression. So naturally I&rsquo;m exited to be in this chapter writing about peace. But the peace of God always seemed so allusive and hit or miss. Studying that story helped me abide in God&rsquo;s overflowing peace. I noticed that when I pray, &ldquo;God please help me be at peace,&rdquo; I always feel more stressed, and I think that&rsquo;s because in saying that, I&rsquo;m acknowledging how anxious I am. But when I pray, &ldquo;God, thank you for your peace,&rdquo; even though I&#39;m feeling anxious, I always feel better afterwards. That&rsquo;s because in doing so, I fulfill the steps Jesus laid out in that story! Have faith, pray, and believe you have it.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praying for peace? You have it with God because of Jesus, if you believe. You have it of God because of his faithfulness, if you trust Him. Praying for healing or deliverance? You have it spiritually in the forgiveness of sins, if you believe. You have it eternally in the promise of new life, if you trust Him. &nbsp;Praying for love, joy, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faith, self-control? You have these things supplied abundantly, if you seek God first, the one who supplies them. &ldquo;So I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you&rdquo; (Luke 11:9)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus encourages his disciples to pray consistently, to come to God for what they need, as in the preceding story about a neighbor and father (Luke 11:7-8). This necessitates deeper inspection upon the things we ask for. Matthew Henry writes in his commentary: </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Observe what to pray for; we must ask for the Holy Spirit, not only as necessary in order to our praying well, but as all spiritual blessings are included in that one. For by the influences of the Holy Spirit we are brought to know God and ourselves, to repent, believe in, and love Christ, and so are made comfortable in this world, and meet for happiness in the next. All these blessings our heavenly Father is more ready to bestow on every one that asks for them, than an indulgent parent is to give food to a hungry child&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be patient and continue to pray. When God doesn&rsquo;t answer as quickly as you would like or expect, keep asking, keep knocking. And do so with all humility, trusting that his plans for you are indeed good as his Word promises, and let the peace of God embrace you.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.hd021bre128l"><span class="c16">The God of Peace</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is our God the source of lasting peace, it is also his very nature. God&rsquo;s plan to restore sinful humans back into a loving relationship, as it was in the Garden, supports his title, &ldquo;God of Peace.&rdquo; Paul has an affinity for this name and uses it many times in the New Testament (Rom 15:33, 16:20; 1 Cor 14:33; 2 Cor 13:11; &nbsp;Phil 4:9; 1 Thes 5:23; 2 Thes 3:16; Heb 13:20). We see it in the Old Testament as well. Gideon honors God by building an altar. He names it &ldquo;Jehovah Shalom,&rdquo; or God of Peace (Jud 6:24). </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was a Judge over Israel, the people were severely oppressed by Midian. The Jews were overwhelmed with suffering and blamed God. Gideon asks God why these things are happening and God commands him to be their help and salvation. You can imagine how nervous and helpless he felt. His response is perfect: &ldquo;Pardon me, my lord, but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family&rdquo; (Jud 6:14). When the world looked at Gideon, they saw a small and weak man. But God sees past that and promises Gideon he will be with him. What happens next is incredible. The Son God visits Gideon and performs a miracle in front of him. He&rsquo;s terrified when he realizes that this person is not merely a man but God himself. So much so that God has to say &ldquo;Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die&rdquo; (Jud 6:23). Gideon is personally transformed by this incident. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gideon doubted God&rsquo;s goodness, he doubted God&rsquo;s choosing him, and doubted God&rsquo;s power. Like most of us, he was overwhelmed by life&rsquo;s challenges and lost sight of who God is. But after seeing the deity of God first hand, Gideon shouts, &ldquo;Alas, Sovereign Lord! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face&rdquo; (Jud 6:22). Other Bible characters who also came into God&rsquo;s physical presence exclaimed similar things. The prophet Isaiah cries alike, &ldquo;Woe to me! I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty&rdquo; (Isa 6:5). Simon Peter says the same to Jesus at their first meeting: &ldquo;Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!&rdquo; (Luke 5:8). God&rsquo;s holiness is dangerous to imperfect humans like a flashlight is dangerous to darkness in a room. However, as Isaiah and Simon Peter grew to know God more and trust him, their despair turned into loving devotion. The same was for Gideon. Where there had been oppression and fear because of the Midionites, there was now confidence, joy, and peace because of God&rsquo;s presence. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 297.50px; height: 269.64px;"><img alt="" src="images/image17.png" style="width: 297.50px; height: 269.64px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace is a byproduct of trust. As the airplane passenger trusts the pilot and the safety features of the aircraft for a peaceful flight, so must we put our trust in God and his sovereignty for a peace-filled life. God reveals himself and his trustworthiness in Scripture.

It is also one of the most poorly applied verses. People see &ldquo;For God so loved the world&rdquo; as &ldquo;God loved the world so much&rdquo; and see themselves as something inherently loveable. Not many when asked, &ldquo;Are you a good person,&rdquo; will say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; We have such an inflated view of ourselves, clearly visible in how easily we are offended nowadays. The original language of the New Testament translates this verse as, &ldquo;In this way, God loved the world.&rdquo; This takes the focus off of the world and places it squarely on the &ldquo;way,&rdquo; which the rest of the verse relays: &ldquo;he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.&rdquo; This perspective makes the gift of Jesus all the more precious, for he is the fullest expression of God&rsquo;s love. It&rsquo;s not about you and me; it&rsquo;s all about Jesus.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&mdash;of whom I am the worst&rdquo; (1 Tim 1:14-15)</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c28"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, God&rsquo;s love, is what saves - nothing else. The language here employs the Greek word &lsquo;</span><span class="c25">agape</span><span>&rsquo; for love. It is God&rsquo;s unconditional and enduring love for his creation. Other words for love are used in the New Testament, like romantic love, familial love, and brotherly love. &lsquo;</span><span class="c25">Agape</span><span>&rsquo; is unique in its self-sacrificial expression. When God loved the world in John 3:16, he gave his most beloved. When Jesus loves us by going to the cross on our behalf, he gives his very life. Christians are to reciprocate this love back to God and also to other people, regardless of the outcome. When Christians love others, they are to do so without thought of themselves. But because of sin and selfishness, </span><span class="c25">agape</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;love among people I would say is very rare. </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c28"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a great little story in Luke about the importance of loving others. It&rsquo;s about a rich man and a poor man named Lazarus. Everyday the rich man would walk through his gate and everyday Lazarus was sitting there in poverty. The rich man gave no attention to Lazarus or his exceeding need. The day came where both the rich man and Lazarus died; Lazarus went to Heaven and the rich man went to Hell. The rich man sees Lazarus is in Heaven and begs to let his friends who are still alive know about the realities of the afterlife, but God denies him, saying, &ldquo;If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead&rdquo; (Luke 16:31). We can glean from this passage that divine &lsquo;</span><span class="c25">agape</span><span class="c1">&rsquo; love for others has a direct correlation to one&rsquo;s eternal destination.</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c28"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christian&rsquo;s expression of &lsquo;</span><span class="c25">agape</span><span>&rsquo; love is a clear verification of their personal transformation by the blood of Jesus, from sinner to forgiven, from forgiven to imputed with the righteousness of Christ. This is the marker that God looks for when judging people at the pearly gates - the mark of Christlike repentance. James writes that &ldquo;faith without works is dead&rdquo; (2:26). One may trust in the name of Jesus for salvation but have no actions to support his or her claim. In this way, &lsquo;</span><span class="c25">agape</span><span class="c1">&rsquo; love is an action that supports the Christian&rsquo;s claim: </span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them&rdquo; (Eph 2:10)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus has an interesting conversation with Simon Peter in John 21. It continues for several verses, but the heart of it is this line of questioning: &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you&rdquo; (vs 16). The word for love that Jesus uses is </span><span class="c25">agape</span><span>. The word for love Peter uses is </span><span class="c25">phileo, </span><span>or brotherly love</span><span class="c25">. </span><span class="c1">Jesus is asking Peter if he will be devoted to him, if he will obey and live for him. Peter verifies his dedication to Jesus by showing how he cherishes his kinship with Jesus. He isn&rsquo;t just repeating what Jesus says to him but expounds upon the depth of Jesus&rsquo; love for him. Peter will go on to be the bedrock from which the early church was built. He went from publicly shaming the name of Jesus three times to embracing the love of God and applying it in and through his own life.</span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.wrd4de2bwhtg"><span>Loving is Living For </span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul gives the title &ldquo;ambassador&rdquo; to Christians as a calling. If Christ had not come to save the world, to suffer and die of his own accord, all would still be lost, dead and ruined, slaves to sin and destined for Hell. &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s love compels us,&rdquo; (1 Cor 5:14) &nbsp;he explains, to give everything in return. The apostle Paul knew fully well the terrible fate meant for workers of iniquity, a title Jesus gives to those who break God&rsquo;s laws. This knowledge drove him and many others to spread the news that there is a way of escape. Christ&rsquo;s love gave him courage to press on when people&rsquo;s offense at the news brought him death threats and great suffering. Christ&#39;s love to us has a like effect: when taken to heart, his love transforms us. We should, then, not make ourselves, but Christ, the end goal of all our living. What a waste it is to throw away His sacrifice by living to ourselves. Return to God the life he gifted to you (Rom 6:23) and he will return to you (Mal 3:7). This is the message of reconciliation, the ministry of forgiveness: </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation&hellip; For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God&rdquo; (1 Cor 5:19; 21)</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is exceedingly broken and lost and desperately needs to hear the news that Paul understood, that we understand. The bad news is that God is a good judge and will not let crime go unpunished and God sees no one as inherently good. The good news is that God offers life to the guilty through Jesus. Therefore, shine forth the love of Christ in everything you say and go and to everyone you meet. In this we are ambassadors for Christ, emissaries of his love. And do not fear, for, &ldquo;there is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love&rdquo; (1 John 4:18). We do not fear because we are not under the law of sin but under the law of grace (Rom 6:14; 8:1-2).</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the one transformed, the command to love God with your whole heart, mind, soul, and strength, is a genuine desire and supersedes the luxury of comfort. It only becomes a burden when our sinful heart demands precedence. Jesus&rsquo; apostles gave everything to this cause. Examine the effort given by each apostle to advance the kingdom of God. Each of these men went to great efforts to fulfill their mission, except for Judas, and each of these men were willing to die for what they believed, except for Judas. They were such a threat to Satan and the sinful world they preached to that they were made examples of in death, to no avail obviously. Peter was crucified but refused to be killed in the same manner as Christ so they did so upside down. Andrew was beaten and then hung on an &ldquo;X&rdquo; shaped cross. James son of Zebedee, Mattias and Paul were beheaded. Philip, Bartholomew, and Thaddaues were crucified. Thomas was burned in an oven, Matthew was axed to death, and James son of Alphaeus was thrown off a tower and clubbed to death. These men are legends for their faithfulness to the end. Judas was the only one who didn&rsquo;t serve the gospel with his life, but selfishly hoarded it and killed himself from shame. Nonetheless, we can learn just as much from him as the other disciples.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always two options to God&rsquo;s calling on someone&rsquo;s life. If you&rsquo;ve seen the movie &ldquo;Mission Impossible&rdquo; you know the famous line, &ldquo;your mission, should you choose to accept it.&rdquo; In that moment, the protagonist has the option to walk away and forget the message. But he never does because he&rsquo;s committed to his job and to the cause. The faithful disciples were just the same. &ldquo;We love because he first loved us&rdquo; (1 John 4:19) is the most succinct reason to be faithful with every last breath. In this verse, we see </span><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c25">agape</span><span class="c1">&rsquo; again; we &lsquo;selfless love with everything we are&rsquo; because he &lsquo;selfless loved with everything he was.&rsquo; Who Jesus is was the catalyst for the disciples&rsquo; faithfulness and their goal in death. Who Jesus is is everything.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 325.23px; height: 378.82px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 325.23px; height: 378.82px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asks his disciples, &ldquo;Who do people say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (Matt 16:13) to gauge their hearts and understanding. Then he directs the same question on the disciples. Peter steps forward alone and proclaims with boldness, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God&rdquo; (vs 16). The people didn&rsquo;t stand up for Jesus because they didn&rsquo;t believe he was significant whereas Peter did so because of his unsquashable conviction. It&rsquo;s been said that you live for what you love. Peter loved Jesus so much and his horrible death is a testament to that. What are you laying down your life for? Could be happiness, could be security, could be pleasure. It could be any number of things, but if it&rsquo;s not Jesus, your love is meaningless and will not last. As much as jewelry companies would like to believe it, a diamond is not forever. No kind of love affects the person like love from and for God. So be an ambassador.<br></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more ways to love and live for God than laying down one&rsquo;s life. Though at the heart of them all is eagerness. Jesus, teaching about the kingdom of Heaven, shows its unparalleled worth by giving two metaphors (Matt 16:44). He says it&rsquo;s like a treasure hidden in a field, and when a man finds it, he sells everything he owns so he can buy the field and claim the treasure for himself. Jesus also says it&rsquo;s like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he finds one in a store, he sells everything he owns so he can afford it. &nbsp;The point of this parable is to show the value of the truth Jesus spoke of, the value of Jesus himself. To inherit the kingdom of Heaven is to inherit brotherhood with Christ sonship with the Father forever. What would you give to inherit eternal bliss? It seems like a rhetorical question to me, but many see Jesus and choose their temporary life instead. They are snared by the trappings of success and shiny things and so forfeit the free gift of God. Search your heart: what are you living for? If it&rsquo;s not Jesus, your striving is meaningless and will produce nothing that lasts.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important distinction about love is that to love God is the same as to love people. One love consciously loves &nbsp;the other. Another way to look at is that loving God means loving the things he loves. Jesus gives a parable to illustrate this point in Luke 10:25-37. A man asks him how to be saved and figures out his own answer is the two greatest commands: to love God and to love others as yourself. But he&rsquo;s still confused and asks Jesus to clarify who is our neighbor. Jesus tells a story about a man who was robbed and about people who passed by him. Which of these people was a neighbor to the robed man, Jesus asks. The one who shows mercy: </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. &lsquo;Look after him,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have&rsquo;&rdquo; (vs 33-35) </span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good Samaritan loved the poor man by living for him as Christ lived. He loved the man as Christ loves the church. Do you think the Father was pleased with Jesus when he loved the world by dying on the cross? Do you think He&rsquo;s pleased with us when we die to ourselves and show love in similar ways? These are closely connected: &ldquo;If anyone says, &ldquo;I love God,&rdquo; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen&rdquo; (1 John 4:20). So we live for God by living for his created people. We love God by loving his children.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not only so, but loving others is a determining factor to the security of one&rsquo;s salvation. It is not merely an outward action or inward feeling, but must be a life changing focus. John writes again, that &ldquo;if we love our brothers and sisters who are believers, it proves that we have passed from death to life. But a person who has no love is still dead&hellip; Dear children, let&rsquo;s not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions. Our actions will show that we belong to the truth, so we will be confident when we stand before God&rdquo; (1 John 3:14; 18-19). This passage goes hand in hand with James 2:26, Matt 5:16, and Ephesians 2:10. Faith is the Christian&rsquo;s primary identifier and God&rsquo;s mark of approval. But faith is only verified when one acts on it. One can claim groundbreaking faith to his or her peers as much as they want - you know, he goes to church, he raises his hands in worship on the weekends, and he calls himself a Christian, but when he is tested and life becomes hard, he blames God and leaves. There was no substance to his faith. It&rsquo;s like dotting all the &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; and crossing all the &ldquo;t&rsquo;s&rdquo; but after stepping back, you realize all you&rsquo;ve written is gibberish. But true faith writes out a clear message: my life, bought with a price, is no longer my own but a tool for God and the furtherance of the gospel. Check yourself - faith that does not produce substantive love for God and care for people is worthless. </span></p><h3 class="c38 c24 c29" id="h.8jfdbyx2toy0"><span class="c16">Love Has No Enemies</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jesus teaches the two most important commands (Love God and Love Your Neighbor), he makes no distinction between them. To ask which one is more important misses the point. So to ask who your neighbor is misses the point as well. The Jewish teachers understood the identity of &ldquo;neighbor&rdquo; as only those who were of the same country, nation, and religion; people with whom they were pleased and preferred to have close. But to Jesus, a neighbor was everyone around him, even those he didn&rsquo;t like. Even after being beaten, mocked, and scorned on a cross, Jesus prays for them (Luke 23:34), asking the Father to forgive them! Despite how poorly he was treated, Jesus still cares for them. And he shows the same depth of love for everyone he meets. Even those he rebukes, Jesus loves by giving them truth.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our culture is a lot like the way of the Jewish teachers. We are inclined to love those who love us in return. How deeply we are moved by politics is particularly revealing. Democrats are taught to embrace other democrats and simultaneously show disdain for republicans. Republicans are mentored likely to love those familiar and hate those unfamiliar. This two-party bias extends to all facets of life. People who</span><span>&nbsp;love the Lakers hate the Celtics. If you love Coca Cola it&rsquo;s likely that you hate Pepsi. People</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;love their boyfriend or girlfriend and hate their ex. These and all examples can be simplified as such: you love yourself and hate anyone and anything that doesn&rsquo;t. But God&rsquo;s love breaks this narrow-minded boundary. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that God demonstrates his love by sending Jesus to die on the cross. Romans 5:8 gives this love great meaning: &ldquo;While we were still sinners Christ died for us.&rdquo; A sinner is divided from God (Col 1:21) and is an enemy at war with God in his heart (Rom 8:7). Why should God give everything for those who hate Him? A mystery that cannot be fully understood, though God gives us a clue in John 3:16: &ldquo;God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.&rdquo; The simple answer is that God loves his enemies because that is who He is, that is his unchanging nature and why he is perfect.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, we must aim for perfection in how we love. We can, in fact, be perfect if we love, because &ldquo;the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: &ldquo;Love your neighbor as yourself&rdquo; (Gal 5:14). Holiness is God&rsquo;s standard of perfection, and he says we can be holy by keeping his commands. It is a sign that we truly love Him. We show that we trust God and prefer him when we follow his instructions, just like when you listen to your guardians. The Lord Jesus teaches that we must do everything we can to show kindness to all, foremostly to their eternal souls. We must pray for everyone and treat everyone as we ourselves would want to be treated (Luke 6:31). Though many will repay good only for good, we must be willing to do so for evil. This speaks boldly of whom our allegiance lies with.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father&rsquo;s commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one&rsquo;s life for one&rsquo;s friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. (John 15:10-14)</span></p><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 432.00px; height: 285.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 432.00px; height: 285.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your&rsquo;re a child, you think and speak from a point of ignorance.

Paul uses this metaphor to picture spiritual growth, and yet he admits the futility of that endeavor: &ldquo;For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.&rdquo; (1 Cor 13:11-12). It&rsquo;s both an acknowledgement of human fallenness and a great expectation of things to come. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c28"><span>&ldquo;All things are dark and confused now, compared with what they will be hereafter.

When we enter Heaven, these will be fulfilled and forgotten. But love will be perfected and fully enjoyed for eternity! We will be perfectly loved by God and perfectly love one another. Biblical Love is the greatest because it never fades. Seeing God face to face, not as in a mirror dimly lit, we shall see love in its final form! What a glorious day!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Solomon said it best: &ldquo;Now all has been heard; </span><span class="c20">here is the conclusion of the matter</span><span class="c1">: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 emphasis mine). Is your life given over in love, for the purposes of God and the propagation of the gospel good news? Without love for God and concern for our fellow man&rsquo;s eternal destiny, there is no fear of God nor keeping his commands. Love is at the heart of abiding with Christ.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Tools from Ch. :</span></p><ul class="c43 lst-kix_tn1rkiz7bebq-0"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Ha</span></li></ul><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Prayer is Powerful:<br></span></p><ul class="c43 lst-kix_tn1rkiz7bebq-0"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">T</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c6 c29 c63" id="h.hlarc7qwl3n3"><span class="c15"></span></h2><h2 class="c2 c29" id="h.m85xualqsgkj"><span class="c15">Chapter Fifteen: Yeah, it&rsquo;s Still Jesus</span></h2><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c7">Last Chapter Theme: Waiting and Watching for Jesus&rsquo; Return</span></p><ol class="c43 lst-kix_i1woh5s9ibhf-0 start" start="1"><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c7">Looking to Jesus for Strength for the Fight</span></li><li class="c6 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c7">Be Ready for His Soon Return</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s a good reason why the Bible lasted as long as it has, why Satan&rsquo;s every attempt to stop the Church failed.

It&rsquo;s the substance of who he was, is, and is to come; that is why we follow Him.</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is not the picture in a frame, the still Jesus</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nah, we serve the Rock, the harder than steel Jesus</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, how we gon&#39; be solid and let the world steal Jesus?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When the world and its trends pass away, it&#39;s still Jesus</span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c25 c31"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c25">Stand Up</span><span class="c1">, Shai Linne</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus is our ultimate example for godly living. To escape fear, shame, anger, pride, strife, and lust and put on as armor, faith, hope, joy, humility, peace, and love. One could write on these subjects forever, about the rich blessing it is to be forgiven and called a child of God.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Running the Race to Win</span></p><p class="c6 c90"><span class="c1">Final Thoughts - Be Set Apart</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">There comes a time in a person&rsquo;s life when they come to a crossroad. Halfway down the road, you see it. You don&rsquo;t want to reach it because you know your path will change so you start to feel wheezy and consider turning back. Then you remember everything that&rsquo;s happened so far, all the people you met along the way, every experience good and bad. You think, &ldquo;I know the way if I turn back. There&rsquo;ll be no surprises. But I already know where I&rsquo;ve been. My goal from the start was to go places I&rsquo;ve never been,&rdquo; and press on. </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before long, the crossroad is before you. A big signpost shows many directions and many destinations. All of them are appealing and all of them appear to meet the standards of your goal. They glitter and shine and light up, trying desperately to attract your attention. Then you notice a small shriveled up arrow pointing straight ahead. It is the oldest sign and is falling apart. Even though the other signs say things like &ldquo;adventure,&rdquo; &ldquo;true love,&rdquo; &ldquo;inner peace,&rdquo; and &ldquo;save the world,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re intrigued by the little sign. It reads in jagged, rot-infested letters, &ldquo;Jesus Christ.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is life&rsquo;s great test. What are you living for? What are you choosing when push comes to shove? Have you committed yourself to the cross and are you willing to stick by your word even when things get hard or when temptations arise? </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the decision to press on down the straight and narrow path that gives one&rsquo;s faith substance and meaning. On it we find the power of God, the transformative Holy Spirit, the way the truth and the life, Jesus Christ! Are you willing to miss out on &ldquo;adventure,&rdquo; &ldquo;true love,&rdquo; &ldquo;etc,&rdquo; for the sake of following Jesus? If so, continue reading. If not, maybe go back to chapter one and finish conquering your doubts.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we are freed from sin, before we repent and turn away from bad habits and false truths, we are no threat to the Devil. But now that we&rsquo;ve dealt with many of the underlying challenges behind living for Jesus, it&rsquo;s time to talk about the next step.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we&rsquo;ve learned from Scripture how to tear down the invisible barriers holding us back. We&rsquo;ve identified them and used the truth to defeat them. Now it&rsquo;s time to put your courage to the test. Now that God has disabled the lies in your heart, it&rsquo;s time to pick up your sword and join your brothers and sisters in battle! </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s raging wildly all around us and the amazing thing is that God gave us the necessary tools to fight. God doesn&rsquo;t really need our help, I mean he&rsquo;s God, he can obliterate Satan with a snap if he wanted. But because of his fatherly love, he delights in letting us be part of his projects. When my Dad would ask me to help him fix things around the house, I felt so loved and appreciated. The same is with our Father in Heaven. He wants to empower us and include us in the eternal struggle of good and evil.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I are on the front lines of a spiritual war that&rsquo;s been going on ever since sin entered the world through Adam. That&rsquo;s an insane thing to say and insan-sier to think about! Only the guy who carries a &ldquo;The End is Near&rdquo; sign would believe such a thing, right? Before you scoff or pick a side of this debate, consider the passage below.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c28 c50"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil&rsquo;s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms&rdquo; (Eph 6:10-12)</span></p><p class="c24 c14 c28 c36"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c28"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right away some key words should jump out: the devil&rsquo;s schemes, powers of this dark world, spiritual forces of evil... Consider also the conversation God has with Satan in Job chapter 1:</span></p><p class="c36 c24 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c67"><span class="c1">Then the Lord said to Satan, &ldquo;Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c14 c67"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c36 c24 c50 c67"><span class="c1">So Satan answered the Lord and said, &ldquo;Does Job fear God for nothing? Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil, who our culture deifies as a powerful being of immeasurable cruelty, is literally asking God&rsquo;s permission to persecute Job. Isn&rsquo;t that funny? Our greatest enemy is a speck of dust in the way of God&rsquo;s vacuum. But as you can see that doesn&rsquo;t stop him. Satan is a schemer! He is devious and looks for any way to make God&rsquo;s people stumble. Thankfully we have the one true God on our side, who gives us assurance of victory when we fight. Do not be fooled! The devil would love nothing more than for you to believe the war wasn&rsquo;t real. Then you&rsquo;d be no threat to him or his forces.</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we fight? If the enemy is spiritual and can&rsquo;t be seen, what am I supposed to do? Paul continues his instructions from Ephesians 6:10-12. He tells us exactly how to fight and what to fight with:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c50 c28"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God&rdquo; (Eph 6:13-17)</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c28"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a quick look at how protected you are if you put on the whole armor of God:</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.b2797c720207c107562afb9599faaaaab384a119"></a><a id="t.15"></a><table class="c33"><tbody><tr class="c37"><td class="c71" colspan="1" rowspan="4"><p class="c19 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1">The Word of God protects you and fights for you</span></p></td><td class="c70" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Salvation grounds your mind</span></p></td><td class="c45" colspan="1" rowspan="4"><p class="c19 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Faith guards you against the enemy&rsquo;s lies</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c37"><td class="c70" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Jesus&rsquo; righteousness covers you with the love of God</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c37"><td class="c70" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Truth brings you stability</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c37"><td class="c70" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c19"><span class="c1">Peace helps you forget the past and move forward</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c28"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re whole body is covered head to toe, your tender flesh becomes a force to be reckoned with! The belt of truth-- it holds up the rest of your armor and gives you stability. The breastplate of righteousness-- it is your last line of defense and protects you when all else fails. The readiness of the gospel of peace-- the fastest shoes in the universe; they take you forward even when your body is tired and can&rsquo;t move. The shield of faith-- your primary defense against every attack, so use it often. The helmet of salvation-- gives you courage in the midst of heated conflict and reminds you why you&rsquo;re fighting. And the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God-- it is both a weapon and a defense and is your greatest asset. Notice how every angle of attack is protected, how every weakness is strengthened. And even more so is the attack power the armor gives you! The Devil is right to be afraid of God&rsquo;s people!</span></p><p class="c6 c14 c90"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c28"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it&rsquo;s not enough just to know about the tools. You have to put them to practice. My encouragement to you is to step out in faith and try something scary. At the end of his time on the Earth, Jesus spoke to his troops: &ldquo;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age&rdquo; (Matt 28:18-20). God encourages us not to be afraid. He reminds us of his sovereignty and power and wants you to take that with you as you fight for his kingdom. We fight by following Jesus&rsquo; example (Matt 16:24). We fight the enemy by going out into the darkness, pulling people out of the fires, healing the lies in their heart with the truth, and bringing them to a place where they can trust God, repent of their own sins, and join the fight themselves!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church isn&rsquo;t just a place for meeting. It&rsquo;s your home base! It&rsquo;s the regiment God placed you in! Every God fearing Christian around the world is part of his army, and God placed you here for a purpose. So study the word of God in preparation for the fight, break down walls with prayer, and help rid the world of darkness by introducing the way to lost souls, the truth to clouded minds, and life to the spiritually dead. Jesus is the cure. Spread the news!</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Tools from Chapter Fifteen:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Prayer is Powerful:</span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c58 c20">END BOOK WITH PHILLIPIANS 3:20: </span></p><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c58 c20"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c20 c75 c5 c84">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our citizenship is in heaven.
